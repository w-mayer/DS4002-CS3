with greatest delight and personal respect.Well, I am  VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY
SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars).This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond
by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of Cï¿½te d'Ivoire.Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from Cï¿½te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another neaarby country where taxation will not
takegreat toll on the money?(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
theinvestment of this money?(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
willbe invested?Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount at the end of this business. The security
of this business is very important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very

( chairman kenneth lay says enron is cooperating with the sec inquiry . ) one partnership , run by enron chief financial officer andrew fastow , added $ 236 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2001 , boosting enron ' s $ 425 million in net income in that period . the partnership ' s contribution plunged to $ 5 million in the second quarter ended june 30 , but investors only found out aug . 14 - - when enron filed its quarterly 10 - q with the sec . oddly enough , that was the day chief executive jeffrey skilling unexpectedly resigned . expect class - action lawyers to go after the profits skilling and other insiders made by selling $ 660 million in stock when shares were flying high .

' s ( ge ) ge capital unit , warren buffett ' s berkshire hathaway inc . ( brka , brkb ) and royal dutch / shell group ( rd ) have been named as potential buyers for enron . ms . coale said the takeover speculation was "" unwarranted "" and has surfaced each time enron shares faltered . "" it would be very unusual . . . for a company to be interested in a takeover ( of enron ) given the uncertainty of the sec inquiry . why add that uncertainty to your portfolio ? "" she said . furthermore , ms . coale said , it might be difficult for a company such as shell to clear regulatory hurdles because it already operates a substantial energy trading business . commerzbank ' s mr . meade also discounted the takeover speculation . he likened such a deal to the acquisition of a financial - service company . "" you are buying a human - capital - based business . you have to make sure you ' re not going to loose all your people , "" he said . "" it ' s a trickier acquisition . "" but not everyone thinks the takeover speculation is implausible . roger hamilton , an analyst at john hancock value funds , said shell and enron are "" neighbors "" , and shell has looked at enron "" on and off . "" still , he said that if there is a buyer for enron , the company would want to do it sooner rather than later in order not to risk damaging enron ' s leading market position . some marketwatchers said at least some of the pressure on enron shares in recent trading sessions has come from mutual funds liquidating their positions to avoid having the company ' s name appear among their holdings in their annual reports . despite the rise in enron shares wednesday , there remains a significant amount of uncertainty about the stock . in addition to the pending sec inquiry and the lingering credit concerns , attention also is being paid to their effect on enron ' s trading business . while several trading counterparties have said that they are watching the situation closely , at least one , entergy corp . ( etr ) , is said to be trimming its exposure to enron . the new york mercantile exchange also plans to use enron ' s weakness to recapture part of the over - the - counter energy derivative market by offering its own clearing services and trading tools for the natural gas market . write to christina cheddar at christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com copyright ( c ) 2001 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron trades higher after heavy losses by lisa sanders , cbs . marketwatch . com last update : 1 : 27 pm et oct . 31 , 2001 houston ( cbs . mw ) - - shares of enron , which had lost about 66 percent of their value over the past 10 sessions , spiked in wednesday trading after a report that pegged the beleaguered company as a takeover target . enron ( ene : news , chart , profile ) added 13 percent , or $ 1 . 46 , to $ 12 . 62 in recent dealings . volume was heavy at 25 million shares . john olson , an analyst at sanders morris harris in houston , pointed out that the heavy losses enron sustained over the last 10 sessions partly reflects the end of the tax year for mutual funds . the calendar year for funds ends at the close of business wednesday . "" mutual funds who own enron stock have been trying to offset other gains by selling off enron , "" he said . "" mutual funds have to register all their gains or losses and offset them by selling or buying stock by the close today . "" a wall street journal report wednesday speculated on enron ' s potential as an acquisition for a more stable company . enron has been under pressure for more than two weeks , beginning when the energy merchant reported a $ 1 billion charge in its third - quarter earnings . a securities and exchange commission probe into two of the company ' s limited partnerships and a rating downgrade by moody ' s investors service haven ' t helped . olson said he thought an enron takeover unlikely at this point . "" however , if the stock were to keep coming down , and their financial difficulties were extended , the odds would increase , "" he said . art smith , chairman and chief executive of the research firm john s . herold , said he ' d be surprised if enron was not entertaining offers .

"" it ' s doubtful that a potential acquirer can resolve all the valuation issues quickly , "" smith said . he said it ' s likely that any sort of purchase agreement would contain what he called a "" look - back provision , "" which would protect the acquirer from being strapped to a fixed value . smith said he could see either general electric ' s ( ge : news , chart , profile ) ge capital or royal dutch shell ( rd : news , chart , profile ) making a bid . both were mentioned in the journal report .

today!I don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all, 
metaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written 
well, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll 
depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a 
recent metaphor.I'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at 
the average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude, 
though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of 
enthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open 
source worlds that I don't like or believe in.Take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (""Gnu's Not Unix""), 
HURD (""Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons""), WINE (""Wine Is Not an Emulator""), even 
PHP (""PHP Hypertext Processor"") - all carry on the tradition of recursion in the 
Unix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff.So it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could only 
have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the edition 
of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time over the 
course of a year talking about what's wrong with our system than what's 
right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get would be 
a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or 
those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right? People would 
disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. This, of 
course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way - the perfect 
recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual 
inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from outside the US 
disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans. Ideally, they would 
be comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being 
disagreeable. They would, of course, point out things about which citizens of 
other countries can disagree with Americans on. By exercising the right to 
disagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. Yet another level of 
recursion and a final layer of metaphor.The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming. In 
the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of the 
two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting opinion 
published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express honestly held 
opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the 
metaphor in a perfect way.Things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not sure 
whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's just 
been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will 
remain mercifully nameless:
We get enough
America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and schools here
in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here)
from Belgium whining too!
Followed by:
... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation
of Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who 
would be able to replace him.
... and, in a later note on the topic ...
Censorship is to be encouraged in a
free-market society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the
government.
Clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some.
Chris 
has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial 
piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is no 
exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill 
comments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has 
shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans 
with opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes 
the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch.So, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue to 
occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff.Just watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye 
out.

your set TODAY, ONLY $29.95!Win Apps in Linux?Yesterday, I mentioned an interesting review of two products for Linux by CodeWeavers - CrossOver 
Office and CrossOver Plugin. You've probably heard of both by now, as they've 
garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the Linux world. You'll 
recall that I promised to try to secure copies for review this week. With the 
help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was able to accomplish that task 
this morning. True to the second half of the promise, we'll spend the next few 
days looking at these two products and how they might impact your Linux use. 
Let's take them in chronological order, starting today with CrossOver Plugin.A bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, "" ... the 
leading corporate backer of the Wine Project. Wine has been, for the past several years, an 
ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but 
it's also one that's been undertaken by others in the past year or so. Though the progress has been 
slow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development 
realm.
CrossOver 
Plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its 
release, Wine had taken a ""full system"" approach. Running Windows applications 
in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of 
configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide 
approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system 
startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called 
program. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on creating Linux functionality with one related set of Windows 
applications: browser plugins.The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a 
success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player 6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser 
plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web 
Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need 
covered.But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package 
are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several 
Microsoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications 
offered by the CodeWeavers developers.Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install 
process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with 
my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped 
for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want these apps to work.The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin 
installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the 
background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\ drive on my 
machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight - the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for 
feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped 
out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed 
four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the 
CrossOver program. I kept ""retry""ing and, with some persistence, managed to get 
a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally, 
the install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows. 
When the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary, 
located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\ drive and dropped the 
plugins into the /home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins 
directories.The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these 
browsers - ""Help"", ""About Plugins."" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin 
was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the ""Men In Black 
II"" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly.I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax 
Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the 
CrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me to 
the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. Within a half-hour, I had all installed and tested.Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite 
the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went as 
smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact, 
reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty 
strong given my previous troubles with Wine.I also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda. 
In every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless.Wine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the 
tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With the backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development, 
Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications 
seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so strong that, if I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better 
in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I 
missed them until I started using them in Linux today.Tomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office 
package.

Kernel Configuration - Part IXWe're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to 
go. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration 
screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and 
function of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear 
decision as to how to configure each section.Today, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you 
need parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either 
as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module.Most will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer. But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example, the builds 
I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the 
telescope cameras were attached to this port.Be aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for 
the parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP, or Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and will work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your printer 
following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the 
BIOS.Tomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration.

Netics 2.0http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/marius/netics/""Netics is an extensible network statistics collector. It puts the network 
interface in promiscuous mode and reads the data stream (after it strips off the appropriate protocol headers), then displays the results at specified intervals, either in a ""progress bar"" mode or as raw statistics. Currently, it supports 2 
statistics, both involving entropy: LZW compressability and Ueli Maurer's 
universal statistical test. Maurer's test is a very good and comprehensive 
measure of entropy, but requires a large amount of data. The LZW statistic 
requires much less data.""

open-source some time in 2000, so my information likely was correct
at the time I compiled that list.In addition, please note that, just because a company decides to go open
source with a codebase as of some new release version, that doesn't make
all versions ever released open source retroactively.  A licence
attaches to a _copy_ of a creative work.  So, if there was a
proprietary, non-redistributable copy in SuSE boxed sets, it's still
proprietary and non-redistributable -- unless SAP AG decided to mail out
a separate permission grant for it.

pretty, I'll give it that. However, there seemed to be loads of bugs - sawfish threw wobblers all
over the place, so I tryed out metacity - which doesn't have a GUI
configurator, and arsed if I'm going back to the fvwm days when you had to
set settings by hand, without an idea what the values looked like. So, I went back to 1.4 - and now sawfish can't start applets (yes, I did
change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH back) and the panel can't make new workspaces. Any ideas what could have happened ? Would sawfish 2.0 silently change
the config files & break them?Kate

74,0.057,0.88,0.063,-0.3132,"accents : linguistnet in the news since victor raskin kindly kept me supplied with the responses he received to his july 6 query about the westfield accents petition , i was unusually well prepared to respond when a reporter meredith o'brien phoned me july 8 to ask if i had an opinion as a linguist on the matter ; when i told her about the linguistnet discussion of it , she was quite surprised and interested to learn of the existence of such a thing , and it turned out her ediotr was too , and the result was an article which is as much about linguistnet as about accents . the first such that i know of . i contacted victor to get his permission to use what i 'd gotten from him , but of course neither of us could contact quickly enough the many linguists whose responses i was faxing to the newspaper . i figured , and victor agreed , that messages sent to linguistnet are more or less public , and that in any case this was a very good and positive opportunity for us to do some educating of the public , which we are always looking for opportunities for . i certainly hope everyone who was quoted in the article agrees that i did the right thing in making the linguistnet discussion available to the reporter . i think the reporter did a good job of it . here 's the text of her article : springfield ( mass . ) union - news , westfield edition , friday , july 10 , 1992 , p . 1 linguists criticize accent position by meredith o'brien westfield - victor raskin , a linguistics professor at purdue university in indiana , was quite perplexed when he saw an article in his local newspaper about westfield 's petition to prohibit instructors with accents from teaching elementary school students . "" has anybody else seen a weird piece in the newspaper about a measure taken by the greek mayor of a small massachusetts town with a very ethnically mixed population to prevent people with foreign accents to be employed as grade school teachers , "" raskin asked subscribers to a linguistics computer network this week . "" besides killing my own chances of ever teaching grade school over there , is this measure nonsensical linguistically ? "" he queried . responses to raskin 's question have been coming into the world-wide computer network called "" linguistnet "" all week , some from as far away as the netherlands and australia . and those who did respond had nothing good to say about the petition . raskin is one of several linguists who have assailed the petition , which has also been chastized by education officials - - including the state secretary of education - - as unfounded and racist . the school committee 's curriculum subcommittee wednesday night unanimously rejected the petition because the committee 's attorney told them it was legally unenforceable . the full committee will vote on the issue at its next meeting which has not yet been scheduled . the petition 's organizer , laura lee whitten , had no comment on the subcommittee 's decision . meanwhile , the eight linguists who called into "" linguistnet "" on their computers concluded that parents should not be worried about their elementary school children acquiring an accent from their teachers because the chances of that happening are next to impossible . network subscriber , barbara partee , chairwoman of the linguistics department at the university of massachusetts , concurs with the conclusions of her colleagues . "" what research exists on this matter makes it very clear that it would be nearly impossible to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher "" , she said wednesday . "" young children , almost universally , pick up their accents from their peers . "" she said if people looked at immigrant families where the children were born in this country , they would find that the children have not adopted their parents ' accent . many others agreed . "" i used to live in boston , where you can cut the local accent with a knife , and played the organ for a church in arlington , mass . , where the pastor and his wife were from the midwest , "" craig thiersch , a linguistics professor from tilburg university in the netherlands said . "" but all their children had strong ' towny ' accents . "" "" my own rather limited experience is that children are n't influenced by the foreign accents of their parents , much less their teachers , "" echoed university of georgia professor michael a . covington . "" kids get their accents from their peers , "" agreed susan ervin - tripp from the university of california at berkeley . while the linguists roundly criticized the petition , some said they could understand why some parents signed it . noting the problems some college students have in understanding some of their foreign professors , they acknowledged that a teacher 's english should be understandable . but the existence of an accent is not a reason to rule out the hiring of an instructor , they said . "" my own opinion is that it is legitimate to require that teachers be understandable to their students , but that is presumably a normal job qualification that does not require a petition , "" partee said . she said at umass , foreign instructors and professors are screened to assure their english can be understood . "" but no one has ever been disqualified because of an accent . "" [ end of newpaper article . ] in the same paper , there was a nice column by william raspberry . much of it repeats things we ' ve been over on the net ; i extract here a bit from the ending : "" as one who was taught french by a german - accented professor who used to amuse us with her talk of "" consonants and wowels , "" i understand why some parents might be wary of having their youngsters taught reading by teachers whose pronunciations are too far from standard . but what in this nation of a thousand accents is too far from standard ? and who determines it ? how much of the whole business is simple prejudice against hispanic teachers ? how does one draw the line between a legitimate interest in occupational qualification and an illegitimate interest in ethnicity or national origin ? where is the universal principle ? kant might not want to hear this , but the principle is the problem . a good principal would handle the thing without working up a sweat . she 'd listen , make some experience-based judgment as to whether a teacher 's accent might prove an impediment to beginning readers and make the appropriate assignment . she might not even be able to tell you , in close cases , what tipped the judgment one way or another , but would that really be so awful ? only if you try to make it a kantian universal . make it a principle , and you ' re stuck willy-nilly with language panels , ethnic spokespersons , teachers ' union reps and , of course , lawyers . before it 's over , people will stop speaking to each other across racial or ethnic lines , and everybody will be working to get everybody else fired or defeated for re-election . the problem , of course , will remain unresolved . as they say in massachusetts ( or would if they thought of it ) , some things can be addressed in terms of the philosopher 's "" universal law .

Float:Â Â  5 MillionInsider & Institutional Holdings:92% SharesÂ Â Â "" CXIN MEDIA CORPORATION, THE BLOOMBERG OF CHINA."" - Finance and Investment Magazine, December 2001Â THE COMPANY:CXIN Media Corporation is an integrated media company focusing on the dissemination and aggregation of information. Currently, CXINs core business is in the publishing and aggregation of Financial, Economic, and Business Information on the Peoples Republic of China. The value CXIN Media provides is its ability to source, package, and present information that is highly in demand by the market.Apart from the core print and electronic publishing business, CXIN is involved in other related businesses, such as organizing and managing events such as conferences, seminars, and training in the field of wealth management and personal finance.These areas are closely linked to the core competencies of the company and they intend to leverage on the brands that they have built to further drive the growth potential.CXIN holds the key to success in the Peoples Republic of China. In May of 2001 they acquired the 12 year exclusive right from the China Economic Information Network, a corporation under the direct management of the State Information Center and the State Planning Development Commission, Chinas highest economic decision body.HIGHLIGHTS:May 2001, CXIN acquires the 12 year Exclusive license to distribute all information in English, French and Spanish, Internationally.February 2002, CXIN announced its first distribution contract with a leading market research provider.March 2002, CXIN announces it had signed with yet another distributor for its unique financial , economic and business information on the Peoples Republic of China.Â May 7, 2002, CXIN announces a distribution agreement with Internet Securities, a Euromarket company and the leading provider of emerging market securities.May 9, 2002, CXIN announces it had hired one of Asias top media consulting firms, Telesis, and its President, Mr. Cyril Pereira, the former Director of Operation of the South China Morning Post and Asia Magazine.June 12, 2002, CXIN launched its China Business portal and began selling subscriptions.June 24, 2002, CXIN announces the acquisition ofÂ  Smart Investor Magazine and related business. This magazine will bring over $1.2 Million in consolidated revenues.Â July 15, 2002, CXIN announces the license agreement with Lexis-Nexis, one of the worlds largest aggregators.INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:According to the reports from Morgan-Stanley, which analyzes the worlds superpowers in 11 industries, it only takes 8 years to build a media empire, which means the return on investment in this industry will be far greater than that of pharmaceutical, household merchandise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well positioned to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing Chinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted by the Chinese government provide the company with an ""unfair advantage"" over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent license agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will enable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Million within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancing, we foresee that CXIN Media could easily double their expected revenue and profits through strategic acquisitions. The current price of the shares do not reflect the value of this growth company, in comparison to the sector CXIN Media should be currently trading between $0.25 to $0.50 and above this value when we take into consideration the growth factors.Disclaimer: The Wall Street Weekly provides information on selected companies that it believes has investment potential.

time assignment process outlined in the order . if elections for primary point capacity exceed available space , el paso will pro rate the space and allow shippers to select other primary points in an iterative fashion until all shippers have primary point rights equal to their firm capacity rights . chairman hoecker said this case illustrates the fact that overbooking pipeline capacity is even more problematic that the overbooking of airline capacity .",0

of Palladium, you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold, including
reading messages and erasing the traces.  I'll buy a chocolate sundae for
anyone who can show otherwise.An attacker might be able to verify that you *have* read a message (e.g.  
by seeing that you saved and edited a copy) but not that you *haven't*.

""don't use things like goto and break to alter flow of control
in your program"".  While not valid 100% of the time, it's a 
reasonable rule of thumb.  The idea is that, when looking at
code, it's easier to see how control moves through a 
function if your basic control blocks do all the work.  The
specific example of replacing a break in a while loop with
a modified while() expression shows this.  You only have to
look in one place to see when you'll run off the end of the
loop, not hunt through the whole loop.  (Although that particular
example wasn't really that good, since the extra test was 
adding on (... || done) and setting done = true in the loop.
Which is much the same as a break really.)The idea is to surprise the next programmer as little as 
possible when he sees the code.In a similar vein, having a break in every case of a select
block makes the flow much clearer.  Flow goes in, zero or 
one case blocks are executed and flows comes out the bottom.
Leaving out break statements breaks this assumption.My point is that, while there are a few situations where it
makes sense to leave out the breaks, I usually tend to 
consider the break at the end of each case more like the
brace at the end of the while block.  In fact, maybe it wouldn't have been a bad idea if the language
was designed such that the continue statement meant fall through
and break wasn't needed:   select (x) {
      case 1:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
      case 2:
         /* do something - falls through to next case*/
         continue;
      case 3:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
      default:
         /* do something - doesn't fall through */
   }Still, hindsight and all that.  Sigh.Later,
Kenn--

  terminal window if I want to do this - which is quite often.  And
  if the message is q-p encoded or a non-text/plain mime type, I end
  up with all that raw garbage too).Anyway to fix this?(BTW: standard i386 redhat7.3)Thanks.> kreCheers

111,0.007,0.855,0.137,0.9977,"(Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 7591666  Dr. Kataga Bakori
Lagos, Nigeria.
23rd July 2002
Attention President/C.E.O
                   
Dear Sir,REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as 
being utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council 
(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade 
exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with 
you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and 
hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and 
projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our 
control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, 
which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a 
foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual 
account to receive the funds.The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria 
which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded 
themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The 
present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors 
and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we 
have identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue 
of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was 
therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas 
partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY 
ONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter. the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed 
so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government 
financial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation 
of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria 
(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or 
any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main 
partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of 
account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for 
payment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, 
and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process 
would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist 
us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 
million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for 
taxation and miscellaneous expenses.The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful 
execution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will 
not disappoint me. I will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your 
knowledge when I have heard from you.Thanks for your co-operation,Yours faithfully,Dr. Kataga BakoriNB: Please respond by sending a facsimile (Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1

I just want to be sure, that forwarding an email to my own spamtrap address
which performs a razor-report on the entire received email is not waste of
time, because the contents of the forwarded email is not recognized as equal
to the email originally received. The forwarded email has a new set of
headerlines, which should be discarded and instead the headerlines of the
original message are in the body of this new message and should be recognized
as such and treated properly.An ordinary Forward Unquoted in Agent is subject to character set conversions
and does not depict the received spam in its original form.I hope this clarifies my concerns.- JÃ¸rgen-------------------------------------------------------

' no ' would be the response to the question ' do you have the time ? ' if the speaker did n't have the time . * generally : a couple of people commented that ' no ' definitely does not mean ' yes ' in these contexts . what it does is rather to negate the possibility of a negative belief concerning the answer to the question . in the example above , for instance , b . is negating a . 's possible belief that b . is not well . why south africans hold that the possibility of such negative beliefs is so strong they have to be denied remains to be seen . * ' no ' in other varieties of english the use of ' no ' in the types of examples cited anyway is not recorded according to the responses in : - australian english - american english - english english it is recorded in : - nigerian and ghanaian english there do appear to be related ( but not identical ) discourse uses of ' no ' and similar particles in other varieties of english . few english responses actually dealt with this usage at all . by far the majority were on ' man ' * ' no ' in other languages ' no ' does seem to be used in a variety of other languages in the same way as in sa english . similar uses are recorded in : - the scandinavian languages - german ( 'd och ' - similar but not identical ) - cameroon french - bangkok thai ( ' plaw ' - lit .

' man ' my question here related to the use of ' man ' to express a negative emotional involvement of the speaker of some sort - irritation , impatience or annoyance . examples given were : man it 's hot today hurry up mom , man man , i can't this right * english a huge response that showed that ' man ' is used similarly in : - american english ( both ' black ' and ' white ' ) - scottish english - tyneside english ( in north east of england ) - jamaican english - welsh english - an ' americanism ' found in other varieties of english . the american english usage at least does not necessary carry negative sentiment and is ' a more general tag . . . over which any kind of emotional intonation can be laid ' . example b . above , an example which typifies sa usage , was found to be odd ( ' wierd ' ) by american respondants . the reason for this is that ' man ' although an interjection still appears to ' have the flavour of a term of address so that ' mom , man ' sounds like two forms of direct address in a row ' . it seems , then , that ' man ' in sae does not bare the feature ' term of address ' at all in such contexts . the only instance in which similar usages were given was in tyneside english . ( ' shut up man geoff ' ' those kegs are too tight man mary ' . here though , the actual term of address occurs finally as opposed to the use of ' man ' finally in sae . this needs to be explored further , but of further interest : - there is a distinctly ' american ' use of ' man ' in sae that is not like the south african use of man ( ' cool man ' type of utterances ) . - other sa examples of man : - daddy , man ! ( 5 year old daughter after i stood on her toe ) - man , david , i do n't mean that ( wife and self in ' altercation ' ) - no man , that 's not right . - man ! this bloody computer is giving problems . - saenglish ' man ' alternates between shwa and full vowel in all contexts . ( in sae shwa occurs as a vowel in stressed contexts - 's it ' can have shwa for eg ) : related usage in currant american english is the use of 'd ude ' . * other languages related uses of ' man ' include : - dutch - swedish ( ' boy ' is used in a similar way ) - norwegian - ? german use of ' etwa ' may have similar function - german ( ' usually to indicate weariness ' ) - spanish - ? lhasa tibetan ( ' mi ' - ' person ' ) interestingly in dutch the 'd ouble address form [ as in ' hurry up mom , man ' ] is impossible ( just "" schiet op , man "" must do ) .

did simplify a lot of things, most of the configuration options people
found very useful are still available through gconf. Learn to love
gconf-editor ;) -- metacity can have sloppy focus (Desktop Preferences
-> Window Focus -- there's actually GUI for that), and the delay until

options and the UI does make it a lot easier to use for people who are
either not using it all the time or are just starting to use it. The
GNOME team decided that advanced users who want to edit the kinds of
options you talk about are advanced enough to use gconf-editor.
Personally, I'm fine with that, because I don't find gconf-editor hard
to use :)Julian

July 17, 2002
						--Robert VamosiSenior Associate EditorCNET Software and Internet Services
Â Dear Readers,
So far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier
worms. If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,
these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.
But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the
continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security
news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect
Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.
 
						Â 
Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password
 An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with
a password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm
family. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also
called Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to
send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This
worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users
are not affected.Yaha.e screensaver worm spreading
 The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly
screensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening
attached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also
known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of
a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully,
this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.
Leaky PGP Outlook plug-in 
PGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook
e-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail
program open to attack. Fortunately, there is a patch available.

( declerck 1995 : 69 ) in both examples of ( 5 ) , death blocks actualization of the head clause . john cannot be a disloyal member after his death , and bill cannot say anything after his death . nia comes from pragmatic ( real world ) knowledge . declerck assumes that examples like ( 6b ) ( and also ( 5b ) ) are semantically anomalous , although he accepts an affirmative sentence like ( 6a ) . it would be impossible for declerck to accept ( 6b ) , because he considers that all examples of not . . . until must be associated with the sense of actualization , i . e . , not . . . until presupposes the truth of actualization , so that declerck forcibly matches his analysis with data . but not . . . until x died does exist as in an acceptable sentence like ( 5b ) , in which case say another word means $ b ! h ( jexpress in words $ b ! i ( j , although ( 5b ) is also semantically anomalous in the sense of $ b ! h ( jutter / pronounce $ b ! i ( j . besides , some of my informants accept ( 6b ) . those who find ( 6b ) unacceptable must account for the difference between ( 5b ) and ( 6b ) . one solution is that we will let nip work on the one hand as in ( 5b ) and will not let it work on the other as in ( 6b ) . but this solution is ad hoc . the other is that the difference lies in our pragmatic knowledge . even though one cannot say anything after his / her death , s / he can leave something other than his / her words , i . e . , negation of saying something does not always imply saying nothing . one can leave his / her message , will or anything else . hence , a rare reading of ia : people found his will after his death . in ( 6b ) , however , one cannot get married after s / he dies , i . e . , death blocks marriage . we cannot imagine the negation of marriage other than not getting married . this pragmatic reasoning would be more appropriate . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ( 10 ) have also two meanings : ( i ) john kept dozing off , but at 6 : 00 he finally succeeded in keeping himself awake , ( ii ) john went to sleep before 6 : 00 .

163,0.048,0.863,0.088,0.9818,"The Electronic Telegraph Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
 or sick of Sheffield.
 
 Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
 this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
 heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
 
 Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
 with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
 emigrate to provincial Russia.
 
 After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
 article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
 side.
 
 ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
 deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.
 
 ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
 cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
 becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""
 
 The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
 tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
 
 It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
 famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
 opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
 
 And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
 ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
 enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
 life.
 
 ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
 of whisky for kopecks.""
 
 There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
 halfpenny in sterling.
 
 The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
 will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
 vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
 diehard alcoholics.
 
 While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
 newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
 soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
 settler should overcome the difficulty.
 
 ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
 off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""
 
 One or two potential emigrÃ©s might be deterred by language difficulties. There
 are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
 Mongolian border.
 
 However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
 deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
 which they would like to live.
 
 France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known
 by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".
 
 Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
 weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
 
 Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
 And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
 in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
 that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
 permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
 
 Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
 climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will
 solve itself"".
 
 Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
 Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
 
 ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
 amongst our citizens.""
 
 Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
 surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
 preferred new home.

High-Altitude Rambos
By BOB HERBERTDr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake
Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in
one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the
U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from
Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section
began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do
with Dr. Rajcoomar.Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back
to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight
man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer
refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying
out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him
in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite
jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight
attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,
already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were
not ready to let things quiet down.One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The
marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and
remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any
reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try
to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who
disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were
terrorists on the plane.""I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized
cabin,"" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of
Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an
aisle seat in coach. ""I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire
in a shootout.""Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her
husband, said, ""It was really like Rambo in the air."" She worried that
there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore
did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the
bathroom, he or she might be shot.There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When
the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into
custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals
grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that
anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where
he was thrown into a filthy cell.This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.
Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into
custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening
hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were
eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.
McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,
which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the
incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.
Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident ""too
closely.""If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters
are headed for jail.Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. ""I
had never been treated like that in my life,"" he said. ""I was afraid that I
was about to be beaten up or killed.""Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and
he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful
detention.""We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,"" said
Dr. Rajcoomar. ""So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in
this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of
security.""--

ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""More testimonials later but first, =========== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!INSTRUCTIONS:=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 26.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!

potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!

""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.

""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.

203,0.05,0.84,0.11,0.9914,"hurricane warning derivatives folks , this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line of products . it is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane warning frequency and / or duration . it is our objective to develop derivative products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this exposure . we have generated a partial brainstorm - style list of whom natural counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure : pro - hurricane anti - hurricane the weather channel resorts home depot cruise ships lowes riverboat casinos cnn chemical plants and refineries local tv stations u . s armed forces dry ice manufacturers athletic teams chainsaw manufacturers city governments insect repellant manufacturers state governments it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is important to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional . thus , we have documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the thought that the anti - hurricane entities would be interested in regional products and the pro - hurricane entities would likely be more interested in bundled regional products depending on their exposure . thus far , we have collected and documented all u . s hurricane warning data from 1980 - 2000 in the form of an excel database . the data can be sorted by year , storm , or location on the u . s coastline . total hurricane warning duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary data sets of interest for any given location ( or year or storm ) . the u . s coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly similar size . these regions are : new england , mid - atlantic , virginia , north carolina , georgia / south carolina , east florida , west florida , florida panhandle , orleans / miss / bama , lousiana , and texas . while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes , it has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration is quite volatile and unpredictable . it is believed that this volaility , when graphically depicted and mathematically represented , could be used to effectively demonstrate to would - be customers the impact of hurricane warning frequency on their business financials . in many cases , businesses may be well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves . as we move forward on the modeling front , the data will certainly need to be scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends , satellite availability , population trends , etc . additionally , we need to go further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn ' t decline . on the marketing front , i am certainly open to ideas . it is believed the weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product . given our positive relationship that we currently have with them , they might be the easiest sell . any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when we should approach customers . please respond with any questions , comments or concerns on this project . thanks , charlie",0

ip address is on the HLL it could get a huge negative score, bigger than the Habeas
mark alone. -- sidney

Pay no attention to the bear behind the curtain, and all that.However, at the end of the *last* bear market, in 1983 -- yup, that long ago -- Granville sell-orders caused bloodbaths with boring regularity, a stockholm-syndrome economy had recently been delivered of Keynesian monetary apparatchiks at the Fed and elsewhere, and Henry ""Dr. Doom"" Kauffman opined offhand that interest rates *might* come down finally... and pop! went the market, sending the NYSE volume through the roof. (Record volume then was around a hundred mill. Yesterday, ladies and germs, it was upward of 2 point something *billion* shares).. Back then, I was a mail-cart-pushing, key-punching ""administration"" clerk at Morgan Stanley in Chicago, chief scrounge for a bunch of Masters of the Universe, and everybody at Morgan thought the resulting price-pop was just a technical rally and wouldn't last either. :-). Six months later, people *still* said it wouldn't last, and a girlfriend's uncle was saying that it was too late, he'd missed the train, so he was going to stay out 'till the market came back down a bit. By that time, the Dow was at, what, 1600? I wonder if he's still out, waiting... A 40% decline is a big chunk of change, boys and girls, even if it's 40% of a bubble. Actually, by my count, it's 100% of the bubble, but that's just me. After all, Amazon and EBay's P/Es still need a pressurized cabin to breathe in.So, yes, the market may go lower, but not much more, relatively speaking. At some point, and fairly soon, I bet, someone's going to realize that, even though you wouldn't want to actually trade one for a house, tulips are still nice things to have around.Hint: Interest rates are rediculuously low, they aren't going up any time soon, and, if we can survive the election, the recently-started CEO witch-hunt won't be too much more than Street theater, probably not resulting in much in the way of regulation or legislation. The threat of which, frankly, probably caused this recent explosive decompression in the first place. Your tax dollars at work, if you will.So, in light of the erstwhile bloodbath on Capital Hill, and the real one we just saw a few days ago in the market, it may be time for people to remember what Mr. Rothschild said, and buy now while there's blood in the streets.As to whether the accounting is ""rigged"", remember what Robert Heinlein said: ""Who cares if the game is rigged? You can't win if you don't play.""Cheers, RAH The aforementioned girlfriend, by the way, traded *me* in for an actual Rothschild in 1984, after I insisted on going back to school and talking my way into the back door at the University of Chicago to boot. The cost of anything being the foregone alternative, it sometimes seems to me I'm *still* paying for that detour, but that's a bear of a different color, and it's okay as long as I don't look behind the curtain, right? :-).- --- begin forwarded text From: Somebody Else To: ""R.

My mom just notified me of my aunt Theresa's death. She was my
father's older sister, though I only knew her through a few e-mail
exchanges and a couple of brief encounters as a child. This news
came hours after I received ANOTHER bit of disturbing news:
""Please tell Chris that one of his first fans died last weekend of
a heart attack at home."" I first met Jon Snyder at an Apple user's
group meeting a couple of years ago; to me, he always looked like
a beefier Robert Beltran. Death is something we all must deal
with, but you never seem to be prepared for it when someone
actually dies. A few months ago, Aunt Theresa sent word that she
had seen my show. It was good to know that even though we hadn't
interacted much over the past few years, she was still able to see
me on TV. And even though you didn't know him, you're closer to
Jon than you realize. Witness this message he sent to his boss a
few months ago:
""I evangelized for months last year for having our company at
the first of these consumer computer conferences in Des Moines
last October, but got shot down. The conference was a hit despite
being postponed by 9/11, and having to move the venue at the last
minute. I know... I was there. So, I'm starting all over again
being 'pushy' about our presence at this event in August of this
year. Chris Pirillo, whose Des Moines-based commercial email
publishing group 'Lockergnome' puts this conference together, is a
friend of mine. He was the 'kid' hired by TechTV to host their
Call for Help daily TV program in SF starting last fall. If you
get the Dish network or Mediacom cable you can catch his show. I
have my DishPlayer set up to record his show on a daily basis.
It's VERY well done, as is TechTV as a whole.""
I returned from speaking to another user group the other night and
found that approximately 100 new GnomeTomes had been ordered.
Sweet! When I started looking closer at the numbers, I realized
that Jake was offering his Converting
Vinyl LPs to CD eBook for free - and that's all anybody was
taking. No, seriously - five hundred orders later, and 99% of them
were just for that particular title. Now, while I don't have a
problem with Jake's offer, I do want to encourage you to check out
the non-free titles (and if you've already looked, please
look again). A lot of blood,
sweat, and tears went into them - and they're just as helpful. In
fact, Jake's also written one for OS X (which
probably wouldn't impress you if you weren't using an Apple
machine). Although, I'm sure plenty of you use
Dreamweaver.
Which reminds me: Jake's also now authoring our Webmaster Weekly
newsletter. So, if you haven't read that in a while, I'd encourage
you to give it another glance. After all, as Elwood
Edwards so finely said: You've
Got Lockergnome! Thanks to David
Lawrence for making that MP3 a reality. El can make one with your

Online BrandingThe Evidence is Against You
Scribbled by Jim GirardEvery time some new technology has expanded free access to popular
music, starting with radio broadcasts of recorded songs in the
1930s, the recording industry has fought it - claiming that it
would cost them money. And every time, it has resulted in
increased sales. The best-known example, of course, was the
advances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including
Dolby sound technology. As with MP3, this technology was opposed
by the music industry as different from previous such
developments, because it made it possible for ordinary people to
create their own copies at near-professional quality. The actual
result was the creation of a whole new profit center for the music
industry - pre-recorded cassette tapes - which actually became
more popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of CD
technology).The thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect -
 and they are not really aiming to stop the private exchange of
songs in MP3 format. If that were their goal, they'd be
instituting widespread, aggressive legal actions against all the
server-centered nodes (as they did against all radio stations
playing their music in the 30s, when they really thought the
phenomenon was going to wipe them out). Instead, they have focused
on the best-known services - first Napster, then Morpheus, KaZaA,
and most recently, Audiogalaxy. Even in those cases, they've
limited their legal challenges to things they know they can win -
 and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to
avoid the possibility of setting some damaging precedent).The point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright
is not a property in the same sense as most of the things we think
of as property. One key difference is that if you don't defend it,
you lose it. If you left your car sitting in the driveway, with
the window open and the keys in the ignition, and somebody drove
away in it, that would still be theft - and you'd still be
entitled to get your car back. Not so with copyright. If you are
aware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you
are voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. It's for
the same reason that big companies insist that newspapers put a
copyright or trademark symbol after the names of their products
whenever they're mentioned, and not use words like ""Coke"" or
""Kleenex"" as generic terms. They don't really expect everybody to
do what they say - and they're well aware that having the name of
one's product become the generic term for a product is actually a
great marketing boon. But if they DON'T do that, someone at some
point could start using the word on their own product, arguing
that it is in the public domain.The efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually
stopping the exchange of music between individuals - which they
know from long experience, increases their sales because most of
the people who normally buy the music aren't really satisfied with
near-perfect copies. For most of them, the learning curve and the
cost in time of creating those copies themselves outweighs the
cost of simply buying the CD. Most of the outright piracy is
committed by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the
first place. What the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at
establishing a public record of their efforts to defend copyright,
in the broadest, most public way; to prevent anyone from making a
legal claim that the stuff they own has entered the public domain.
The thing they're really worried about, in terms of profits, is
the change in the marketing model. Even legitimate online music
commerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a
few good songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for
if they were buying the stuff song by song. The problem is how to
make as much money on a per-song basis - and, at the moment, it
requires charging far more for an individual song that most people
are willing to pay.At any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of
civil law, with a good deal of history behind it - dating back to
the Renaissance. The strategies music companies use are clearly
directed to realities and necessities, in light of history and
case law. They have also done a great PR job, convincing the most
technically knowledgeable people on the Internet that it is a
simple moral or criminal issue. ""Common sense"" tells a lot of
people that copying music without paying for it is just like
stealing someone's car, and represents a loss to the owner. But if
common sense could decide the issue equitably, we wouldn't have
the law in the first place. Most of our great intellectual
systems, including not only law but science, are designed in large
part to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the
case in civil law than criminal. The people who work within those
systems are well aware of that, but they are also well aware that
most people aren't - and that it can work to their advantage. Any
time a highly paid civil attorney begins by telling you that an
issue vital to his client is actually very simple, or just a
matter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what
he means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you
believe that. If it really WERE that simple, the client wouldn't
be paying him as much as he is.Submit Your Thoughts | Recommend It!A BOOK FOR EVERY GEEK: Want to know more about networking? Have you ever wanted to write an e-book?

My Virtual Modelhttp://www.myvirtualmodel.com/{Make a model of you} Wouldn't it be cool if you could physically
walk into cyberspace? Well, you can't... so stop thinking about
it. However, you can design a virtual model of yourself on this
site. Choose your features like body shape, eyes, nose, lips,
facial hair, height, and weight. The amazing thing is how closely
your model resembles you. My only complaint is that you can't add
glasses. How in the heck is my digital doppelganger supposed to
see? Once you're finished, the site can even offer style advice
for your body type. (I'll stick with plaid, thank you very much.)Recommend It!

Top 75 Tech SitesWho has no trouble with controling his codes? Lockergnomie Wayne
Smith: ""Here is a bit of information specifically for Hotmail
users who may have trouble opening your links, due to the service
wanting to place the referred URL in a separate frame. I receive
my Lockergnome newsletters via Hotmail and find it really useful
when you folks include the link as text. However, sometimes this
isn't practical - or it stops the flow of the article. The trouble
here is that the link sometimes returns the message: 'There was an
error displaying this link' in the frame. No problem! Right-click,
copy shortcut, paste to metapad (freeware from LIQUIDNINJA.COM),
then do a global search and replace. The trick is to replace the
control codes with the correct characters: %26 is an ampersand;
%3a is a colon; %2e is a period; %20 is a blank space; %2f is a
forward slash; %3d is an equals symbol; %3f is a question mark.
The Windows character map can help with any others. Select a
character, look at the status bar, replace 'U+[code]' with the
percent sign. In other words, the ampersand (U+0026) is %26 which
translastes into a '&' symbol. Maybe a more clever Gnomie can come
up with some script which we can place in the 'Web' folder,
correctly register, and use in IE's right-click / context menu?""Recommend It!http://www.lockergnome.com/issues/daily/20020712.html

234,0.04,0.889,0.071,0.9673,"re : 6 . 797 , comparative method : n - ary comparison gotcha ! there are two separate fallacies in the argument against n-ary comparison which i discussed recently and which powers , delancey , and guy are now apparently seeking to defend . ( 1 ) janhunen says that the probability of a match occurring purely by chance when you compare japanese with four languages is four times what it is when you compare it with one language . this simply cannot be true because probabilities are values between 0 and 1 . if the probablity in the case of a binary comparison was say . 5 , then he would be predicting that it would be 2 in the case of n-ary comparison , which is impossible , because 2 is not between 0 and 1 . ( 2 ) the other fallacy is not purely mathematical , although i suspect that it involves elements of confusio . in any case , no one who argues for n-ary comparison ever talks about getting a match in 2 out of n languages . now , if we look at guy 's numbers , in his scenario of a 100 - word list with no shifted meanings , he came up with 14 . 5 probable spurious mathces in a binary comparison but only 5 . 8 when you are looking for a match between 3 out of 5 languages , 0 . 13 when you look for one between 4 out of 5 , and he does not give the much smaller number yet in the case of 5 out of 5 . i am not sure how jacques defines spurious and so i have not verified the numbers , but they are certainly on the right orders of magnitude . as you consider more and more languages ( also as the initial probability of a match declines , which usually happens as you go from toy models to real data ) , what happens is that you need fewer and fewer out of the n languages being compared to agree . thus , in guy 's example a match between n - 2 languages out of 5 was less likely to occur by chance than one between 2 out of 2 . but if n were 100 , i . e . , you were comparing 100 languages , then you would not need n - 2 ( i . e . , 98 ) languages to agree to be able to do better than with a binary comparison . it would be many many fewer ( although i do n't know how many since i do not know what formula jacques is using and what he is assuming about the initial probability of a match ) . maybe , he could kindly supply the numbers . and in light of all this , let us add another argument for rejecting indo - european : bopp never offered a mathematical demonstration that the relationships he proposed were unlikely to be due to chance , much less by doing a binary comparison of every pair of indo - european languages . which i think just goes to show how unrealistic the whole idea of doing such comparisons is . but if you do want to do them , then at least let us be clear about how to do them so as to minimize false positives ( i . e . matches due to chance and not really reflective of common origin ) as well as false negatives ( i . e . , failures to find genuine historical connections ) . on the second point , there are arguments that n-ary is better . alexis mr",0

Date: Not suppliedDisney's themepark business is in deep trouble in the post-9/11 world. A war 
with Iraq could really kill 'em:     While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit by 
    steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping deliver 
    record profit for Disney year after year.     ""The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new,"" 
    said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. ""It was an astounding 
    growth period.... Now they're overexposed.""...     Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to fall 27% to 
    $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias. By 
    2003, she said, the business could climb to $1.49 billion, depending on 
    whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.  Link[1] Discuss[2][1] http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-disney6oct06,0,1287712.story?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dbusiness%2Dmanual

and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down
when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT
disenfranchised. They
get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is
more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these

the check_local tarball includes a program called miltrassassin.
It's a C Milter program speaking the SPAMD protocol so it will be
far more efficient than spamass-milter.
Check http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/miltrassassin.html
for some details about miltrassassin.                                                                                                                                                                     
The check_local tarball can be downloaded on
http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/beta.htmlAnother alternative solution is to use Mimedefang : it offers
anti-spam, attachment defanging, custom filtering.regards, SL/---

298,0.033,0.867,0.1,0.974,"DEAR SIR,I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.Best personal regards,MRS MARIAM ABACHA.--DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam--

ago, I can guarantee you that the learning curve for reading
ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different. Of course once
you've memorised (not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them
and learning them off by rote) them, you wonder what all the fuss is
about before.It's not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over
another, but if that's all there is in the difference, and the
learning curve for the Operating System is the same, then I know
what I'd prefer, as a beginner.This is all getting rather off-topic now anyways, but since I've
been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week I jumped
on the bandwagon.--

bert , jr . chairman federal energy regulatory commission 888 first street , ne washington dc , 20426 dear chairman h ? bert : since last summer , the committee on energy and commerce has closely monitored the electricity situation in california . today , the west continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century , and california faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again this summer . after extensive review of the energy crisis in the west , including several hearings in washington and california , we recommend that the commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity prices and keep power flowing into california . we recognize the commission ' s efforts in recent months to address the electricity crisis in the california and western markets , including measures to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices . while we are pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout the west , we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and the entire west in the hot summer months to come . to ensure that prices are just and reasonable during the critical months ahead , we believe the commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices in western markets . we strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market participants within the entire western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) . specifically , such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the wscc . the plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and failures to comply with agreements to sell power . if the commission finds that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan , it should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the full extent allowed by law . aware of the danger of discouraging supply , the commission has relied upon market - oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts . we share the commission ' s concerns regarding the need to encourage supply . accordingly , to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long - term solution , the commission ' s comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission . to mitigate prices and increase available supply , we also urge the commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote conservation and demand response throughout the western market . in states where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs , consumers have less incentive to conserve . while demand reduction incentives are not a substitute for accurate price signals , a demand response program can encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity . such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both wholesale and retail consumers to sell , at market or other incentive prices , "" foregone "" electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume . specifically , the commission should : ( 1 ) establish or certify a wholesale "" clearinghouse "" for demand reduction agreements ; and ( 2 ) enable consumers , whether individually or through aggregation arrangements , to sell foregone power to their own local distribution utility or to third - party purchasers . we recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demand reduction programs , but a broader , regional solution is needed to enable sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer . we understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting state laws , abrogating existing contracts , or shifting costs to non - participant consumers . we look forward to working with you to build upon the commission ' s previous efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for consumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter . to ensure maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead , we request that you take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as possible . we request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not later than the close of business on friday , june 22 . if you have questions please contact our staff . thank you in advance for your cooperation with this request . sincerely , w . j .

spamassassin/razor interaction.Now for a razor question:I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing.  Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up...  Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.Thanks,
Dave

This'll put it in that particular order for ya.  You can also chose to order it by name, etc by changing this field.

No, that would be rather silly. There are conflicting reports on whether
Zambia is prepared to accept milled GM grain or not - and, from reports from
various sources, considerable debate within that country. There's complex
issues, not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty
environmentalists, which was my original point.TimC------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

"" if that ' s your modus operandi , when things don ' t go well people come after you , "" mr watson says . he believes that image of cockiness made questions over enron ' s balance sheet spiral out of control . the balance sheet adjustment itself could not justify the massive degradation of its equity in a matter of weeks . "" the masses at enron are thirsting for a change in image , "" mr watson says . he intends to give them that . mr watson will remain in charge when dynegy takes control of enron in the coming months . he has asked mr lay to join the board , but mr lay has not made a decision . "" it ' s been a good ride , for the most part , "" mr lay said friday night , but added , "" i would say the last three weeks have not been a lot of fun . "" mr watson reached out to mr lay on october 24 , as the crisis of confidence in enron became increasingly untenable . the securities and exchange commission was investigating its finances , investors were dumping its stock and the credit rating agencies were downgrading its debt . mr watson ' s mother was having heart surgery and he was with her in saint louis . but he called mr lay to offer to help . in the back of his mind was the possibility of buying enron ' s valuable pipeline assets to provide it with liquidity to support its fast diminishing business . two days later , mr watson went over to mr lay ' s home to begin working towards a combination . in a meeting with mr lay and the rest of enron ' s management team , it became clear they were "" willing to fix the problem whatever it took "" . mr watson believes the deal was put together so quickly because dynegy works with enron on a daily basis , they know each other ' s people and businesses , and they are both based in houston . "" we ' re one of the few people , maybe the only ones , who could have pulled it off , "" he says . now that he has done so , mr watson plans to move into enron ' s new buildings , but has not decided whether to rename the stadium to reflect its new owner . his teenager wants him too . but that would seem to go against the modesty that enabled dynegy to win in the end .

' ' there are many risks associated with this merger that we will not know about for a while , ' ' said carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities . ' ' we ' re not sure that we know everything there is to know at enron yet . ' ' in addition , enron ' s earnings could be far lower than it has reported , said james chanos , a short - seller who has been a vocal critic . on thursday , enron said in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that it had used partnerships to overstate its earnings by a total of $ 600 million over the last five years . mr . chanos said other information in the filing indicated that more restatements were possible . with so much uncertainty surrounding enron ' s finances , mr . chanos and other analysts question dynegy ' s decision to move so quickly . they note that dynegy and enron often traded with each other , and some analysts had wondered whether , if enron had filed for bankruptcy , those trades might be wiped out , leaving dynegy unhedged , or unprotected against sudden movements in the prices of natural gas or electricity . if , on the other hand , enron is not forced to restate its profits down further , then dynegy has clinched an amazing bargain . analysts say enron will make $ 1 . 80 a share this year , so dynegy is paying just six times enron ' s annual earnings , about a fourth the average ratio of companies in the standard & poor ' s 500 . dynegy said on friday that the deal should increase its per - share earnings next year by 90 to 95 cents , to $ 3 . 40 to $ 3 . 50 , even without factoring in up to a half - billion dollars in annual savings , before taxes , from the merger . dynegy ' s shares closed friday at $ 38 . 76 , up $ 2 . 26 , so if the company ' s forecast is accurate , it is trading at 11 times its 2002 earnings - - still a bargain compared with the average stock in the s . & . p 500 . jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & company in houston , said dynegy ' s estimates for its earnings in 2002 were ' ' conservative and very achievable . ' ' mr . watson said friday that dynegy was confident that enron ' s operations and its trading business were healthy . ' ' we feel this is a very solid company with plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens the next few months , ' ' he said . mr . dietert said dynegy needed to strike a deal with enron quickly to make sure that enron ' s trading operations and financial health did not deteriorate any further . ' ' if enron preserves the value of the marketing and trading company , then there is clearly value in the enron stock , ' ' he said . preserving enron ' s investment - grade credit rating is crucial to keeping the trading operation afloat . to help convince moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s , the major rating agencies , that enron ' s rating should remain investment - grade , dynegy has agreed to inject $ 1 . 5 billion into enron immediately . still , on friday , both agencies cut enron ' s rating to just one notch above noninvestment grade , or junk , status , and both suggested that the rating could fall further . so investors and creditors will watch carefully this week to see whether other energy companies continue trading with enron , and whether the merger stems the outflow of talented enron traders . another question hanging over the deal is how easy it will be for dynegy to walk away if enron ' s finances turn out to be worse that enron has already disclosed . the merger agreement , according to executives and investment bankers who shaped it , gives dynegy the opportunity to quit the deal without penalty if major new problems surface . but what exactly those terms are remains unknown . so far , investors are giving dynegy the benefit of the doubt . the company ' s stock rose 17 percent on thursday and friday .

' basic accounting ' ` ` what we teach in college is that you don ' t record equity until you get cash for it , and a note is not cash , ' ' said turner , who is now director of the center for quality financial reporting at colorado state university . ` ` it ' s a mystery how both the company would violate , and the auditors would miss , such a basic accounting rule , when the number is one billion dollars .

' ' dynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late october , when watson called lay to offer assistance with enron ' s growing financial crisis , the two men said . that led to a saturday morning meeting in lay ' s kitchen . ` ` he even made me a breakfast roll , ' ' watson said . ` ` he didn ' t eat it , ' ' lay said . lay said he won ' t be an active manager in the new company . watson said friday that he and lay hadn ' t discussed a severance package . as head of enron , lay had refocused the houston operator of u . s . natural - gas pipelines on trading and international expansion , boosting reported revenue 20 - fold since 1995 to $ 100 . 8 billion last year . he said he doesn ' t regret the strategy . ` ` clearly , enron has gotten involved in business that hasn ' t turned out well , ' ' lay said , pointing to money - losers azurix inc . , created to supply water and build related projects around the world , and newpower holdings inc . , a seller of electricity to homes and small businesses . ` ` but you have to keep in mind , too , that 12 years ago we weren ' t in the wholesale merchant ( trading ) business . today that ' s an incredibly valuable franchise . ' ' the trading business , which accounts for about 97 percent of enron ' s revenue , buys electricity , gas and other commodities from producers and sells them to end users such as utilities and industrial customers . it also advises big business customers on energy use and sells them gas and electricity . reassessing steel , lumber watson said the new company will keep trading coal , gas , power and petroleum products , and plans to expand by buying assets and using them to develop trading . ` ` we ' ll just have to reassess over time whether we stay in ' ' trading of steel , lumber and other non - energy commodities , he said . enron wants to shed its 65 percent stake in dabhol power co . in india , which is owed $ 64 million in overdue bills from a state government agency that has refused to pay the power prices enron was promised in contracts . ` ` we have strong legal remedies and we ' re heading down the path toward arbitration , but we ' d still very much like to work out a settlement with the government , ' ' lay said . potential buyers have balked at enron ' s $ 1 billion asking price for dabhol . neither man would comment on whether dynegy plans to cut jobs after the merger , or what will happen to the naming rights to enron field . the major league baseball stadium is home to the houston astros , and enron paid $ 100 million to have its name on the ballpark . ` ` the name of the company is now dynegy , ' ' watson said . dynegy ' s acquisition requires approval from u . s . securities , antitrust and energy regulators . watson expects soon to share details of the new dynegy with regulators from the european union and u . k . , where enron operates a trading desk and owns a water company and two power plants . ` ` i don ' t know if we are required to do so , but we will talk to them anyway , ' ' watson said . ` ` we don ' t think there are going to be any problems , ' ' lay said . citigroup , j . p . morgan mull $ 500 mln enron stake , dow says 2001 - 11 - 12 03 : 06 ( new york ) london , nov . 12 ( bloomberg ) - - j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . may invest $ 250 million each in enron corp . , the company they are advising in its agreed takeover by dynegy inc . , to stop credit downgrades , dow jones newswires reported , citing people familiar with the matter . dynegy agreed friday to buy the largest energy trader for at least $ 23 billion , including at least $ 8 billion in stock and $ 15 billion in assumed debt . moody ' s investors service maintained an investment grade rating on enron after the two banks told the credit agency they were mulling a $ 500 million investment , bolstering the company ' s financial outlook , the paper said . moody ' s decision removed the threat that a junk rating would create a cash crunch by forcing enron to repay early $ 3 . 3 billion of bonds . last month , j . p . morgan and citigroup gave enron a $ 1 billion credit line , using the company ' s pipeline systems as collateral , the paper said . the investment , which raises conflict of interest issues , may take several weeks to complete , the paper said . citibank and j . p . morgan spokesmen declined to comment . moody ' s spokesman also wouldn ' t comment .

> Is the use of ""trusted hardware"" really worth it ?Answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business
model. But, in all probability: no, it isn't usually worth it. So, it
comes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker's job.If the product requires occasional authentication, simple copying
won't work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue is
whether you're actually going to enter into battle with the crackers,
or just make sure that it isn't trivial.A lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to be
more concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans,
and so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likely
to view matters differently.> Does it really make it more secure ?Yes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the same
is ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely to
require resources other than just labour.Almost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possible
to ensure that doing so is uneconomical.> Look at the DVDs.IIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and
one where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.--

    Guido> Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The
    Guido> Perl Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporate
into a procmail environment.  Lots of people use it in many other ways.  For
performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small
C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the
result back out.  I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast
enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the
pickle to an anydbm file).Basic procmail usage goes something like this:    :0fw
    | spamassassin -P    :0
    * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
    $SPAMWhich just says, ""Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into the
processing stream.  If the resulting mail has a header which begins
""X-Spam-Status: Yes"", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable
$SPAM.SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detail
about how its tests fared.  I'd like to see spambayes operate in at least
this way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set
of headers which further processing downstream can key on.Skip",0

"" confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure . this is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much , "" said one analyst who asked not to be identified . the reduction in equity was prominently reported in the wall street journal on thursday , bringing it to the attention of a wider audience , analysts said . lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some wall street analysts . as a result of the operation , enron ' s debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent , but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year , lay said . moody ' s investor service said earlier this week that it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several enron businesses . some of enron ' s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . brazil ' s copene , elektro plan to sell 820 mln reais of bonds 2001 - 10 - 18 13 : 53 ( new york ) rio de janeiro , oct . 18 ( bloomberg ) - - two brazilian companies have asked securities regulators for permission to sell 820 million reais ( $ 279 million ) of bonds , raising the amount of pending local market bond sales to 7 . 5 billion reais . brazil ' s copene - petroquemica do nordeste sa , a petrochemical company , has asked brazil ' s government for permission to sell 625 million reais of bonds according to the country ' s security and exchange regulator , the cvm . banco citibank sa , the brazilian unit of citigroup inc . , will manage the sale . elektro eletricidade e servicos sa , an electricity utility controlled by u . s . - based enron corp . that distributes electricity in sao paulo state , has asked for permission to sell 195 million reais of bonds , according to a cvm filing . no further details about the sales was immediately available . brazilian companies have scrambled to sell debt at home as the local currency , the real , plunges against the dollar , making dollar - denominated debt expensive and causing losses to mount as the local currency value of dollar debts soars . so far this year , about 9 . 1 billion reais of local market debt has been sold . meanwhile corporate bond sales in euros or dollars has slipped by almost two thirds to $ 1 . 7 billion in the third quarter from $ 4 . 5 billion in the second , not including sales through offshore subsidiaries , according to bloomberg data .",0

Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java, please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of October). There will be a technical and writing test, and interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with others.This should be a great learning experience and a fun time.=================================== * Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 ImminentThe second revision will be up on the site soon, at: http://64.78.49.204/The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs).The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done yet. We have made more progress in the testing system.Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the beginning of the book.The book is due at the end of October.

More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's earnings.United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal , a Information-Communication Technology Policy Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to draw participants from local, national and international organizations from both the public and private sector.This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors, users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source, e-Government and related fields.Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy. But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world, so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.See http://www.egovos.org/OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N. ======================Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source tools. Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin of the Information Society Division also announced that this international organisation has been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science and culture.It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising, updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for including new basic documents. ""This work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,"" said Dauphin. Check out the sites atUNESCO Libraries Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_bib/) UNESCO Archives Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_archives/) UNESCO Free Software Portal (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft/) UNESCO Observatory on the Information Society (http://www.unesco.org/webworld/observatory/)NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS ======================Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code (GPL license). See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtmlMeanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme) based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and related issues.""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid Akhtar told this correspondent.Niranjan Rajani , of Pakistani origin but based in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on ""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"".This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects; GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies and lives of these countries.CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS ======================In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's the message that governments across India were recently with, as official computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in varsities, military installations and within government. Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the government sector.On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the news.GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)""The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater . While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet in low-income communities, access is still an issue. Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their homes. LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95< according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.LINC protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. ""Giving a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar projects but had limited success,"" says Slater. LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led organizations that LINC serves. ""Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" LINC explains.LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local support.""We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more effectively,"" said Slater.To view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC Project Linux pages at NEED TO NETWORK ===============Bala Pillai , who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. ""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it. Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to more symbiosis with them,"" says he. Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community. ""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. ""Do look for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. ""I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds. -- Frederick Noronha * Freelance Journalist * Goa * India 832.409490 / 409783 BYTESFORALL www.bytesforall.org * GNU-LINUX http://linuxinindia.pitas.com Email fred@bytesforall.org * Mobile +9822 122436 (Goa) * Saligao Goa India Writing with a difference... on what makes *the* difference ########################################################################## # Send submissions for comp.os.linux.announce to: cola@stump.algebra.com # # PLEASE remember a short description of the software and the LOCATION. # # This group is archived at http://stump.algebra.com/~cola/ # ########################################################################## ------------------------------From: Frederick Noronha Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative] Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMTDear friends,Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to support their cash-strapped initiatives? Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.Jeebesh Bagchi sent in this offer recently. It could surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like ours. --FN ========== Forwarded message ==========The Sarai Programme, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi (www.sarai.net) invites applications for Support Grants to projects in the area of Free Software, Open Source Software and Social Usage of SoftwareSarai invites programmers (practictioners as well as students) to propose projects in the area of free and open source software applications relevant to educational, social and community needs.

( http : / / www . mri . mq . edu . au / ~ mariam / flexht / ) - intelligent educational systems on the world - wide web , held in conjunction with the 8th world conference on artificial intelligence in education ( ai-ed97 ) .

( http : / / www . education . uts . edu . au / projects / ah / ah-94 . html ) more information about adaptive hypertext systems can be found at http : / / www . education . uts . edu . au / projects / ah / workshop focus : there has been a significant amount of research in this area over the past five years ( see workshop theme for more information ) , but two recurring issues have become increasingly important , and these will be the focus of this workshop : - standards : with the increasing popularity of the world wide web and the growing market for flexible document delivery systems , we need to develop standards for these systems in order to encourage and facilitate their use more widely on the world wide web . in order to develop such standards it is first important to more clearly define the requirements for such systems : what does it mean for a system to be a flexible , adaptive or dynamic hypertext system ? following on from these requirements , which techniques are important in flexible hypertext systems ? finally , can we design a standard architecture for flexible hypertext systems which can be re-used widely ? - evaluation : one of the key issues which arose from the first flexible hypertext workshop and which has been aired again recently on the adaptive hypertext mailing list is the importance of the evaluation of flexible hypertext systems . in particular , since the main goal of these systems is to maximise the suitability of a document to the user 's knowledge and needs , evaluation is an essential aspect in the development of these systems . however , very little research has been done which confirms the advantages of such systems or which demonstrates how this might be done . workshop format : the workshop will run for one full day on 14 april . the number of attendees will be limited to 20 in order to encourage participation in workshop discussions . participation will be on the basis of submitted position papers or by invitation . the workshop will include a limited number of paper presentations and general group discussions . group discussions will focus on the issues raised in the position papers , as well as on some focus questions . a workshop dinner will also be organised to encourage informal discussion . the programme will include : welcome and introduction workshop sessions consisting of : 1 to 2 position paper presentations ( 15-30 minutes ) , and group discussion on the issues raised ( 30-60 minutes ) closing : planning for post-workshop activities conclusions and wrap - up workshop dinner the proceedings will be compiled into a technical report after the workshop . position papers : we invite position papers describing demonstrated techniques for improving the flexibility of hypertext documents . we are particularly interested in papers which present innovative solutions to providing flexible hypertext documents , and those which address the need for building standard architectures and evaluation techniques for such systems . we are also interested in receiving papers assessing the benefits and downfalls of providing flexible documents , and papers of a more speculative nature which focus on the future of flexible hypertext systems . those aspects of the paper which are important for discussion in the workshop should be clearly outlined in the paper . papers should be 3 - 5 pages long , and should be put up on the web . if you do n't have access to a web server , then some space will be allocated for you . electronic submission of the url address of the position paper will be preferred , although papers submitted as ascii ( html ) or postscript will be accepted . to submit a position paper , send the url address and an ascii version of the paper itself to : mariam @ mpce . mq . edu . au if this is not possible , please send hard copies to : maria milosavljevic csiro mathematical and information sciences locked bag 17 north ryde nsw 2113 australia important dates : 27 february 1998 : submission of position papers 13 march 1998 : notification of acceptance or rejection 27 march 1998 : camera - ready copies due before the workshop , all attendees will be able to access the position papers from the web . we strongly encourage attendees to read these before the workshop . programme committee : maria milosavljevic ( chair ) , macquarie university , australia . peter brusilovsky , carnegie mellon university , usa . robert dale , macquarie university , australia . paul de bra , eindhoven university of technology , the netherlands . kristina hook , swedish institute of computer science , sweden . judy kay , university of sydney , australia . jon oberlander , university of edinburgh , scotland . cecile paris , csiro mathematical and information sciences , australia . julita vassileva , university of saskatchewan , canada for more information : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - maria milosavljevic mri language technology group macquarie university sydney nsw 2113 australia email : mariam @ mpce . mq . edu . au tel : ( + 61 2 ) 9850 6345 fax : ( + 61 2 ) 9850 9529",0

"" "" why is it that convient mais ne semble pas tres naturel ; l ' emploi de ' that ' marque un registre plus formel . "" "" les exemples semblent appropries dans tous les registres , peut-etre un peu moins frequents dans un ecrit tres formel . "" "" toutes ces questions sont parfaitement ordinaires . "" "" j ' attribue ces phrases au registre courant [ colloquial ] plutot que litteraire . "" "" je dirais que ces phrases seraient acceptees par n ' importe quel locuteur americanophone , au moins dans une conversation informelle . "" les commentaires divergent , certains locuteurs attribuant les exemples a un registre formel , d ' autres a un registre non formel . la premiere personne optant pour le registre formel precise que ce type d ' enonce est caracteristique d ' une question que poserait par exemple un avocat au cours d ' un proces ; mais c ' est peut-etre plutot la semantique de la question qui importe ici , et non le registre . la deuxieme personne ayant choisi le registre formel semble cependant s ' appuyer surtout sur la presence de that . en effet , une autre reponse souligne la difference existant entre les formes ' why is it ' et ' why is it that ' . par consequent nous pouvons retenir des commentaires obtenus que la construction qui nous interesse releve globalement d ' un registre courant - voire familier - mais peut se retrouver dans d ' autres registres sous certaines formes ( avec that vs sans that ) et pour exprimer certains actes de parole . 2 . la semantique de l ' interrogative intervient elle aussi dans le choix de cette construction , comme l ' attestent les 13 remarques suivantes : "" par rapport a la construction plus traditionnelle , celle-ci se limite aux cas ou le locuteur exprime une repetition ou une clarification apres avoir pose la question sous la forme plus courante : me : what did you sayj ? you : i said "" goodbye and good riddancej ! "" me : what is it that you saidj ? i was n't listening closely . "" "" cette construction marquee n ' est appropriee que si le discours precedent a deja etabli qu ' il y aura une reponse non negative a la question . ainsi , l ' echange suivant ne semblerait pas naturel : - who is it that you sawj ? - nobody . "" "" je n ' accepterais pas ou reagirais negativement a la phrase how is it that you did thatj ? . j ' emploie cette construction avec tous les autres adverbes ( where , who , what , when ) pour obtenir un eclaircissement a propos d ' une chose deja mentionnee . "" "" les exemples me semblent normaux si le locuteur met l ' accent sur l ' adverbe interrogatif et exprime une certaine exasperation : what is that thing you boughtj ? "" "" ces questions sont tout a fait acceptables , moyennant un contexte discursif particulier du type reprise . d ' ou la meilleure acceptabilite des versions dans lesquelles le verbe est marque de l ' aspect be + ing ( fondamentalement anaphorique ) . "" "" cette construction met l ' emphase sur l ' element interrogatif . "" "" spontanement , je dirais que cette construction se focalise sur la question plus specifiquement . si l ' on me demandait : who are you meetingj ? je pourrais repondre : a friend . mais si la question etait : who is it that you ' re meetingj ? je me sentirais oblige de repondre plus precisement . "" "" la seule raison justifiant l ' emploi de cette construction est , a mon avis , l ' emphase qu ' elle met sur l ' objet de la question . "" "" en anglais , ces questions sont posees de fa on rhetorique ou pour exprimer une demande de clarification . dans le deuxieme cas , l ' element interrogatif est fortement accentue . "" "" la plupart de ces questions ressemblent a une demande de repetition de quelque chose qui aurait ete mal compris a la premiere audition . "" "" les questions de ce type correspondent a la forme declarative emphatique it is because of x that ou it is x that i am saying ( . . . ) . ces questions en anglais se traduiraient mieux en fran ais par quelque chose comme : qui c ' est que tu as vuj ? qui met aussi l ' accent sur la reponse la ou une question en est-ce que normale ne le ferait pas . cette construction entra ne aussi une accentuation plus forte sur l ' element interrogatif . "" "" dans beaucoup de cas , ces formes marqueraient une emphase utilisee par exemple si je pensais avoir mal compris un message : where is it that you [ said you ] arej ? "" "" pour moi , ces constructions presupposent que quelqu ' un vous a donne l ' information ( what , who , when ou where ) et que vous l ' avez oubliee et devez poser une question sur ce seul element . "" toutes ces remarques s ' accordent pour attribuer a la construction qui nous interesse un sens emphatique utilise pour obtenir une clarification . elle semble aussi s ' accompagner d ' une accentuation de l ' element interrogatif . il est donc interessant de remarquer que la valeur emphatique est commune aux constructions anglaise et fran aise . 3 . parmi les 54 reponses , 11 tentaient d ' expliquer partiellement ou completement la variation de l ' acceptabilite de la construction en fonction de la nature de l ' adverbe interrogatif : "" where is it that you arej ? et how is it that you do thisj ? sont pour moi les constructions les plus maladroites et les moins frequentes . "" "" where is it that you arej ? est maladroit ; je repeterais probablement la question where are youj ? en accentuant plus le where . "" "" je ne pense pas que le that dans why is it that soit le meme que dans les constructions avec les adverbes interrogatifs . "" "" why is it et how is it sont toujours idiomatiques , meme s ' ils sont plutot formels . when is it est idiomatique , mais para t assez pauvre . les autres enonces identifieraient a coup sur le locuteur comme etant etranger .

"" pour des raisons qui leur sont probablement propres , why , how et where se distinguent des autres adverbes . how is it peut s ' interpreter a la fois comme une forme figee qui a le sens de pourquoi ( = how come ) , et comme une construction non figee signifiant comment . . cela explique les differences de perception de cette forme par les locuteurs , qui n ' ont pas toujours pris en compte ses deux sens . why is it a egalement un comportement de forme figee , mais qui garde le sens de pourquoi . pourquoi est aussi un adverbe qui se demarque des autres en fran ais , car la question qu ' il pose porte sur l ' ensemble de la phrase ( pourquoi tu t ' en vasj ? mais * tu t ' en vas pourquoij ? ) . nous expliquons moins facilement la specificite de where qui a ete relevee a 5 reprises . 4 . le dernier facteur d ' acceptabilite egalement souvent cite ( huit fois ) par les natifs est le temps du verbe etre place avant it that . : "" toutes ces phrases s ' emploient couramment en anglais . a noter qu ' on peut aussi bien utiliser ce genre de structure au passe : where was it that you ran into him yesterdayj ?

You should review and then report spamtrap or otherwise.  I'm not
sure how this would affect your rating because I don't have any docs
nor code to look at but I sincerely hope that if that's what you
are doing that it negatively impacts your rating at a near exponential

composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]
The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.
The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...
In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.Cheers,

483,0.031,0.915,0.054,0.9874,"sum : v - initial languages several weeks ago i posted a query in connection with the exceedingly frequent vowel-initial lexical items of basque , in which perhaps 50 % of native nouns and adjectives are v - initial ( i exclude verbs , since ancient verbs almost invariably show a prefix * / e - / in their non-finite forms . ) i asked whether other languages ( apart from the initial-dropping languages of australia ) show a comparable frequency of initial vowels and , if so , whether a historical explanation is known . i was particularly interested in hearing about possible cases of the lenition and loss of initial voiceless plosives , an explanation proposed for an ancient stage of basque by andre ' martinet . one respondent queried whether there was adequate statistical evidence to assert that the basque case is indeed unusual . i know of no such evidence , and indeed one of my purposes was to try to find out whether basque is really as unusual as is commonly believed by vasconists . the following languages were cited in the responses . polynesian : the proto - austronesian consonant system has undergone considerable attrition in the polynesian languages , which today exhibit between eight and twelve consonants apiece . in hawaiian , in which proto - polynesian * / h / and * / ? / have been categorically lost , v - initial words appear to be rather common . but i could not find any explicit discussion of this , and my impression of such hawaiian texts as i could find is that the proportion of v - initial words probably does not approach 40 % , though i am ready to be corrected on this . niger-congo : initial vowels are frequent in a number of west african languages which are not closely related ; the initial vowels generally appear to be of morphological origin . there is uncertainty as to whether the vowels are fossilized noun-class prefixes ( the most popular explanation ) or the residue of derivational processes , such as for making agentive nouns out of verbs . in the cross river languages of nigeria , most nouns are v - initial ; in some of these languages , virtually all nouns are . here it seems clear that the initial vs are fossilizations of ancient noun-class prefixes , in most cases derived from original cv - prefixes by loss of the c . in at least some of these languages , most verb forms are also v - initial , but only because the presence of fully functional agreement markers . benue - congo languages generally lack a distinct class of adjectives . in some benue - congo languages , and especially in some bantu languages , cv - prefixes have instead been augmented for morphological reasons to yield vcv - prefixes , again producing frequent initial vowels . ancient noun-class prefixes appear to be recoverable to varying extents in many niger - congo languages , especially in bantu . importantly , the original semantic values of the prefixes can often be determined , though this is not always the case . the kwa language ( bini ) edo is unusual in that every single noun must begin with a vowel , so that even c - initial loans from english have vowels prefixed , apparently purely for morpheme-structure reasons . yoruba is noteworthy in that it has around 45 % of v - initial words , even though four of its ten vowels cannot appear initially . catalan : a rough estimate suggests that catalan words are about 32 % v - initial , rather more than one might expect in a language with 7 vowels and 22 consonants , and more , i suspect , than are typically found in romance languages . i know of no particular reason for this . arawan ( amazonia ) : many of these languages have frequent v - initial words . it is suggested ( but not established ) that these derive from the loss of initial glottals . in at least some of these languages , v - initial words differ from c - initial words in that the first group may never bear stress on the first syllable . berber : masculine - gender nouns regularly take a prefix / a - / , while feminine nouns take / ta - / . muskogean : these have vc - prefixes on v - initial words but cv - prefixes on c - initial words . it is not clear to me what this means overall . siouxan : these seem to have undergone heavy reduction of initials , not entirely unlike the australian initial-dropping languages , but the results have been complex . siouxan languages particularly show the lenition of initial / p [ h ] / > / f / > / h / , and possibly also some cases of / t [ h ] / > / h / . germanic : the change / k [ h ] / > / x / > / h / is well attested here , but not , as a rule , exclusively in word-initial position ( though sometimes in syllable-initial position ) . lenition of voiceless plosives generally is widespread in germanic . on the basis of this admittedly unscientific sample , i would therefore suggest the following conclusions : ( 1 ) languages in which 40 % or more of nouns are v - initial are not exceedingly rare , but they do not appear to be at all common . the majority of the examples come from niger - congo . ( 2 ) in niger - congo , the initial vowels derive chiefly from morphological sources , probably entirely so apart from the reduction of cv - prefixes to v - in some languages . fossilized noun-class prefixes appear to be the most widely accepted origin in most cases , and such prefixes appear to be certain in some cases , in which the semantic value of the prefixes is still recoverable . but other morphological processes may be responsible in some other cases . ( 3 ) outside of niger - congo , there appears to be little evidence of morphological origins for initial vowels , and loss of initial consonants is more usually invoked . the consonants invoked are , unsurprisingly , more likely to be glottals than oral obstruents . ( 4 ) except perhaps in siouxan , there is little or no evidence for the systematic loss of initial voiceless plosives . so what happened in basque ? i still do n't know . the american long-ranger john bengtson has for years been defending the "" fossilized noun-class prefix "" view of the basque initial vowels , for reasons of his own , but there seems to be no trace of any semantic correlations with the initial vowels , and in fact the frequency of each of the five basque vowels appears to be about the same initially as elsewhere : a > e > i > o > u . my money is therefore still on the systematic loss of certain initial consonants , but i ' ll be very surprised if i ever have to pay out or get to collect . my thanks to maile rehbock , bruce connell , max wheeler , dan everett , john koontz , david stampe , mark liberman , herbert stahlke , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk",0

485,0.062,0.883,0.055,-0.8032,"direct access 8 / 10 / 01 below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding direct access . we will continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated . summary : direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key component of california ' s 1996 deregulation law . under this concept , all customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated utility . the debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to solve california ' s costly power crisis . it will determine whether businesses , with residential customers , pay for the bulk of the state ' s future energy purchases . it also could determine whether southern california edison , the state ' s cash - strapped no . 2 utility , will avoid bankruptcy , and whether deregulation will survive in any form . big businesses , free - market advocates and alternative energy providers have lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so - called "" direct access "" . now , as the state prepares to sell $ 13 . 4 billion in bonds to begin paying off its debt , legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big businesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct - access escape route . regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system , the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long - term electricity contracts through 2021 . that would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying the bulk of the $ 43 billion in future power costs , a point that has enraged consumer groups . currently , only about 88 , 000 customers buy their energy through direct access ( per cec statistics ) , including about 10 , 000 large commercial / industrial customers , and about 78 , 000 residences . alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back to california ' s primary utility suppliers ( socal ed . , pg & e , sdg & e ) earlier this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with utility rates capped by the legislature . california legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the latest edison bailout plan , sponsored by assembly speaker pro tem fred keeley . under the plan , the 3 , 600 largest businesses would agree to pay $ 3 . 1 billion of edison ' s debts over 15 years . in exchange , businesses would be allowed to secure their own power contracts by 2003 , but not without first paying an "" exit fee . "" the fees and which parties would be exempt remain undetermined , however , they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases . it is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding direct access , california ' s business community will have extreme difficulty accepting the terms . to ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fears of a collapsing state budget , lawmakers have gone so far as to introduce two bills , ( one sponsored by sen . bowen and defeated in july , and a second by assemblyman dave kelley , ) that would rescind language in previous legislation that authorized the public utilities commission to block direct access . the california puc has thus far stayed a decision on the matter , but is expected to rule by august 23 rd . complicating the issue is wall street . the state ' s bankers , led by j . p morgan , are nervous about selling as much as $ 13 . 4 billion in planned state bonds if businesses ( currently the largest ratepayers in the state , after governments ) find a way out of the system . the bonds are meant to repay the state for $ 8 . 2 billion in power - buying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs . business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills . if businesses were allowed to sign on with outside energy providers , that revenue stream would be in jeopardy .",0

( n . b . , it 's not like you can go to a school or department of * communication * to study how animals communicate - - - so this is terminological limbo : few linguists really care what animals do ; it 's seen as irrelevant ) . * such truisms as "" there are no primitive languages "" in our intro classes - - where primitive is tacitly understood to mean "" with reduced or without the machinery of morphology & syntax "" . ( this automatically disallows what apes , cetaceans and others do from being called language , given our other claims above . ) * the omission of "" chimpanzee "" in the inventory of world 's languages * such constructs as lad ( language acquisition device ) and "" innate predisposition to language "" applied uniquely to humans . ( have you ever seen anyone positing either construct for the great apes or cetaceans ? ) * in standard theories and stories on the "" origins of language "" with exclusively human protagonists ( bow - wow and yo - he - ho theories , biblical tower of babel ) * in language acquisition classes that study primarily what humans do , with some emphasis on how humans diverge from animals just for comparison 's sake , to see how we take off developmentally from where they stop * in such phrases as "" uniquely human "" and "" social contract "" ( "" signs of the apes , songs of the whales , "" , nova , 1984 , discussing washoe 's use of asl : "" washoe has crossed the line into exclusively human territory . "" ) these are just the tip of the iceberg , off the top of the head . look around with sensitive eyes and you ' ll see the subtle signs of this species-ism everywhere . no one has to plot or say anything overtly species-ist because , given the totality of our system , animals can never break through our self-imposed cultural definitional language barrier ( as sue savage - rumbaugh so aptly notes ) . if a chimp and a child perform exactly the same behavior , the child 's is adjudged * linguistic * and the chimp 's is not , because children , unlike chimps , are said to be "" on their way to language "" ( i . e . , syntax ) . [ thanks to marilyn silva for her assistance to this point ; she thoroughly disavows any connection with what follows ! ] just so that we may see this species-ism more clearly , first a teaching i ' ve posted before , and then a brief outline for a model from a species-inclusive point of view that flows from the teaching . "" long ago , men and animals and spirits and plants all communicated in the same way . then something happened . after that , humans had to speak to each other in human speech . but we retained the old language for dreams , and for communicating with spirits , animals , and plants . "" this is what a non-species - ist ( cheyenne ) language origin story looks like - - all of nature communicating in a common way , and then * humans * moving out of that system and doing something different , the human kind of language , but remaining still connected to the original language processes whether they know it or not . wilhelm von humbolt , founder of linguistics as a university discipline , observed : "" man , regarded as an animal , belongs to one of the singing species ; but his notes are always associated with ideas . "" non - species-ist accounts are alway inclusive and evolutionary , not exclusive . and now for a model that flows naturally from the story . 1 ) we now call * language * every "" natural system "" which has utterances ( incl . sound , gesture , chemical , etc . ) combined with meaning . 2 ) we notice that as well as this sharing , humans also have differences - - different language processes that animals do n't seem to have ( morphology & syntax ) , so we call them two processes of human-specific language , the human kind of language , or just * human language * - - but we no longer designate it by merely the bare word * language * in the old exclusivist , species-ist way . this model declares that humans partake of other processes in the more inclusive * language * as well as those of specifically * human language * , so we look for similarities between humans and animals . indeed , both have motor / gestural components and spatial syntax associated with utterances and meaning , and both ( at least those with limbic systems * * * ) modulate emotions into their utterances . and , perhaps most important of the similarities , both utter idioms ! idioms are funny critters , when you think about it ; as the george foremans of the * hidden side * of linguistics - - the part of human language that does n't work by normal human language rules - - they tend to knock out every bit of morphological and syntactic machinery they encounter , not play by the rules , and consequently can help us question our culturally condoned uniqueness attitude as well . let me explain . it struck me recently , and i ' ve never encountered anyone else discussing this similarity , that the definition of idioms or formulaic speech - - utterances whose meaning cannot be pieced together from the meanings of the pieces , but must be attached to the whole utterance - - is exactly the same as the definition for any act of non-human communication you can find in the textbooks ( for bee dances , bird songs , etc . ) . in fact this definition is perhaps why non-human beings are usually said not to have ( human ) language - - because the pieces of their utterances can't be added up to make the whole meaning the way we say we can using morphology and syntax in human language . humans and animals thus intersect in * language * , in its entire evolutionary range , at most levels - - idioms , sounds , emotions , gestures ( pheromones ? ) - - and then humans only sometimes also construct new utterances from scratch . most typically we tend to use more idioms & formulaic speech with those we know well , and use it less with strangers , with whom we tend to use more formal and public speech . bees and birds and trees tend to know each other in their groups very well and can therefore be said to use idioms in their own languaging . just like us ! - - that is , unless we want to call ourselves sub-human and merely communicating , not using language , when we use idioms and formulaic speech . this move , should you accept it , irrevocably puts humans , land animals , sea creatures , trees , and maybe more , all on the same * language * map . but can these ' wild ' speculations , however evolutionarily based , actually be accomodated within a "" real "" linguistic theory ? about 15 years ago , charles fillmore was working on a unified approach i really admire ( and perhaps it 's a partial fulfillment of the reconciliation annabel cormack called for in vol-5 - 1469 on trends in lx ) , which goes something like this ( any errors are mine ) : when we are "" online "" composing / speaking , which i now must see as similar to dan slobin 's "" thinking for speaking "" mode , our process is to ' reach ' first for a handy ready-made piece of formulaic speech , and then , failing that - - lacking a ' match ' or not liking the proffered ' match ' - - we go on to construct from scratch . nature simply does n't have the further "" from scratch "" level , but shares everything to that level . fillmore 's formulation seems to fit quite nicely the picture of the evolutionary development of language ( and its synchronic effects ) that i have attempted to sketch here . ( sorry for any embarassment my use of it may have caused you , chuck ! ) the degree to which the above species-inclusive formulations may tend to disturb you quite faithfully reflects , i would guess , the degree to which you are embedded in the institutionalized species-ism so pervasive in linguistics , since these formulations are quite possibly the first truly * alternative * origins theory you have ever seen . because language and intelligence are usually linked , this more compassionate model also has the advantage of placing intelligence in nature and not so much the burden of just human beings . with this approach , linguistics could forge an academic path toward reconcilliation between western minds and nature that could provide a powerful rationale for at least slowing down , if not stopping altogether , the current ecocide , and instituting a new-though - ancient attitude of * respect * for the intelligence of nature . no linguist who sincerely wants to understand what * language * is all about can any longer afford to ignore its deeper processes in nature - - natural language , of which human natural language is an important subset . * * * anyone wishing to see how this inclusive approach further includes brainmind research - - the relevant evolution of brain structures and of brainwave rhythms - - can contact me at dalford @ s1 . csuhayward . edu . - - moonhawk ( % - ) ) ( "" the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and ) ( the eyes in his head see the world spinning round "" ) ( - - mccartney / lennon )",0

I'm skeptical.  One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious
rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction
is more ""real"" than the reality.  You see it over and over again in
history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior
Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became
Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you
know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive
People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is
substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the
facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction
that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American
Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth
in popular culture.I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where
you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you
have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal
population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.-James Rogers

The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his 
appearance in order to secure food 
more easily. Encased in the skin of a sheep, he 
pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd 
by his costume. In the evening he was shut up by 
the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, 
and the entrance made thoroughly secure. But the 
shepherd, returning to the fold during the night 
to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly 
caught up the Wolf instead of a sheep, and 
killed him instantly. 
Harm seek. harm find.

TextAloud MP3 converts text to speech and to MP3 
Listen to email, Web pages, e-books, and more on your PC or 
portable MP3 player.  As featured in PC Magazine, The New 
York Times, and on CNN.  Now available with optional
AT&T Natural Voices, the most advanced computer speech for your PC. 
Listen to a demo, then 
download your trial copy.
Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free. 
Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome. 
Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting 
in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that 
the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's 
real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the 
address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes 
Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was 
the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal 
address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is 
now available in all six formats,  
for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content 
based on a couple reader suggestions.Chris may have an obsession with Peets coffee, but I'll bet he's never 
been the daily special. On my visit to St. Louis, for the 
SIC, I 
started every morning with a walk to the West Port Starbucks. 
Apparently my morning ritual was a source of entertainment for the 
employees, which evolved into discussions of a reality based TV show 
based on the concept of stalking me. I've even got the 
incriminating evidence 
to prove it.The SIC provided me the opportunity to see some cool updates to a couple 
titles, in addition to being introduced to some useful audio oriented 
titles I'd never seen before. Expect a number of reviews over the next 
several weeks, as well as extensive coverage of last week's events in 
St. Louis in the annual SIC special issue. Lori managed to score a few 
more Gnomedex giveaways while we were in attendance, so those of you who 
sign up will be coming home with even more goodies, which, by the way, 
aren't of the stressball and pen variety -- we're talking software 
titles with reg codes.

DreamQuest Championship Card Games
For Pocket PC, Palm, Symbian OS
http://www.dq.com/palm.htmlPlaying games on a PDA has killed plenty of my time spent waiting in 
airports around the US. With the recent porting of these three classic 
PC card games from DreamQuest, I've added some of the best in PC 
entertainment to my arsenal of PDA diversions. Hearts, Spades and Euchre 
all play in a similar manner to their PC versions, only on a smaller 
screen. Available for Pocket PC, Palm, and even the Symbian OS, you can 
play cards against computer opponents or connect to the online game room 
and challenge other players using any of the games multiple platforms. 
This is a unique experience currently unavailable for any other pocket games. Â GnomeSKIN

Rexway
http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/56/rexway.html
  
Blending punk rock attitude with country twang makes for a fairly 
unique musical experience. I saw these guys play a show in Omaha, 
back in January of this year and was blown away by their stage 
presence. Rexway rip through an opening set with enough energy to 
kick-start even the most somber crowd, moving everyone in the 
audience to their feet and setting the scene for an entertaining 
evening. As with most punk, the lyrics are equal parts politics 
and angst, with enough colorful language to drop a jaw or two. 
Tool fans should check out the countrified version of the classic 
HWAP; it's kind of like a cover tune, only more unique. If you 
are offended by 4-letter words, this band isn't for you.

Click for DetailsCroupier (NR) 1998
Drama - 94min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)Special DVD Features worth a look-Deleted scenesIn disembodied first person Clockwork style narration,  Croupier
pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers.
We know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the
games. Gamblers, or ""punters"" as they are more derogatorily known,
however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier
(casino dealer).  Constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the
croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. Thus, the
cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others
lose. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier
father (Nicholas Ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade.
Through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, Jack's
father also taught Jack that the only way to win is not to play. Punters
are sorry sods; the croupier is king. From father to son, the lesson
passes -- watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment
in life. Despite decades of croupier training, Jack is compelled to
write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape.
Jack's publisher regrettably relates to Jack that his novel idea is
trite; stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. When
Jack's father informs Jack of a casino opening in a small London Casino,
Jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing
the seedy underbelly of London's casinos. Unfortunately, Jack's ex-cop
girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing Jack for the
worst. In an attempt to fool himself, Jack creates alter ego ""Jake"" to
bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain Jack both morally and
physically unscathed. The absence of any clear delineation between the
personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (Alex Kingston)
approaches Jack with a scheme to rob the casino. Jack slowly comes to
the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino
or in life. You are either in the game, or you are not. Seasoned veteran
director Michael Hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle
talents of the ultra cool Clive Owen. Owen rules this drama, not with
flex and volume, but with glances and nods. Less is truly more, much
more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster
suspense films of recent memory. Croupier proves that it is not a large
budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre.

( i want to note that i have identified 209 ( = 13 % ) causal since-clauses among 1576 causal as - , because - , for - and since-clauses in the machine readable british - english lob - corpus ( written texts from 1961 ) . most of these since-clauses are to be found in the category called ' learned and scientific writing ' . ) another informant , for whom my example sentence ( 1 ) is essentially synonymous with either conjunction , has the impression that the speaker of ( 1 ) using ' because ' "" feels john 's admission more noteworthy , or more important to the narrative , than he or she would if 's ince ' or ' as ' were used . "" into the same direction , i assume , goes another judgement according to which ' because ' is "" stronger and more explicit and more exceptional . "" ( i have found a similar view in the literature and have interpreted it as a consequence of my differentiation : entailment on the basis of a rule or norm is intrinsically less noteworthy , less exceptional than ' real ' causation . ) some people have pointed out the relevance of the position of the causal clause . as a tendency , my rule / norm interpretation is considered to be more in accordance with the causal clause ( be it 's ince / as ' or ' because ' ) preceding its main / matrix clause . however , one informant feels "" more comfortable with since clauses preceding , and because clauses following , the main clause . "" ( this impression is somehow in conformity with the statistical situation in the above mentioned lob - corpus : only about 9 % of the because-clauses are preposed , whereas 41 % of the since-clauses and 43 % of the as-clauses are preposed there . ) one informant pointed out constraints which may affect the acceptability of 's ince ' as a causal conjunction : "" 's ince ' seems to have a much more limited application . for me there is a tense / aspect / ? ? ? constraint between the clauses ( consistent with the temporal meaning it also has ? ? ) , otherwise it sounds forced or stilted . i do n't really like your sentence ( 1 ) with 's ince ' . reversing the clauses makes it more acceptable to me , as does changing ' was ' to ' is ' ( strange ! ) . conversely , changing ' has been ' to ' was ' makes the 's ince ' version even less acceptable to me . "" ( probably , the last point in this quotation is caused by the fact that replacement of ' was ' by ' has been ' makes the sentence grammatically acceptable with a temporal interpretation of the since-clause . ) do i have to conclude from the ' empirical ' outcome of my query that my differentiation is not tenable ? for various reasons ( which i hope to develop convincingly in a doctoral dissertation to be submitted soon ) , i do not think so . are there , perhaps , some more people ' out there ' who agree with my claims , but who refrain from simply stating ' i agree ' ? of course , this would not make my query statistically more valid , but it would suggest that there is some plausibility to my non-empirical reasons . carsten breul e-mail : carsten . breul @ rz . ruhr-uni - bochum . de",0

decent brand will be know about by XFree setup programs in modern
distributions. However, if you have the budget (insurance paying for the
dead monitor, perhaps ? - and WHERE was your monitor that it got caught in a
flood ?) getting a monitor with a DVI input is best. Of course, you'll need
a DVI out video card then, too. DVI provides a much better picture than VGA
because it removes the analog stage - basically DVI gives you a direct
connection from video ram pixels to monitor pixels - the best pictures I've
ever seen on a computer is on my notebook screen at 1400x1050 (which doesn't
use DVI, but an internal connection which has the same effect). Brand wise,
I like Iiyama a lot and I think they may have a Europe wide warranty.Niall--

      Marketing PLAYOF THE WEEK.Â  Our trademark is our 
      uncanny ability to spot stocks that have bottomed-out and anticipate their 
      rebound and upward trend.Â  Most of the stocks we track rebound and 
      peak within just two days, giving investors opportunity to make a few 
      bucks back in such a highly volatile market.Â  We don't believe the 
      market is such as to take any long-term positions right now.Â  But in 
      a highly unstable marketplace, the opportunities for short-term stabs 
      (gains) are abundant.Â  When the question today seems to be which way 
      is up, we like to think that from the bottom there is no other way---it's 
      all a matter of 
timing.

                  URGENT AND NOBLE PROPOSALATTN: DIRECTOR.
DEAR ,I wish to extend my greeting to you and your entire
family. I got your contact from the ivoirian chamber
of commerce, I prayed over it and selected your name
among other names because of its esteeming
nature.Morever,after my strong prayers and fasting,
God reveals to me that you are straight forward,
Honest and GodÂ’s person.
This is the reason I never waste time to propose you
this business for our mutual benefits. Infact, You
will never regret it provided you give me your
possible best cooperate hand, Believe me.I am MARTIN FRANCIS, A cote dÂ’ivoire national and the
only child of late Mr and Mrs FRANCIS. My late father
was the former financial controller of CÃ´te dÂ’Ivoire
telecommunication (CITELCOM). My father died due to
the heat of political crisis in my country recently
last years.But,I am motherless since,before my fathers
late and the death of my mother on 26 SEPTEMBER 1993
was as a result of spiritual attack by our family
member who hated her just because of my fathers
wealth.
Moreover, they tried their own part as well against my
father and myself but negative because God almighty
is available at our side. Infact God is wonderful.
Although, before the death of my father in one of the
private hospital here, he secretly revealed to me
specifically on family matters and mostly the safety
of his monies us$16,500,000.00 (sixteen million,five 
hundred thousand united states dollars) which he
deposited in a bank here in my county Abidjan, 
CÃ´te dÂ’Ivoire and used my name,MARTIN FRANCIS as the
next of kin for the deposits. This amount was accrued
from an over-invoiced contract award for the
construction of an underground telephone network to
replace the former in the new city (Yamoussoukro) and
other major cities also for installation of the
microwave station awarded to my late father,Mr JOSEPH
FRANCIS in 1999 to expatiate companies. In fact, after
the finished payment of  contract workers, my late
father deposited this fund in a bank as the full
beneficiary contractor of the said company (CITELCOM)
this is the fund I want to transferred to your account
as the beneficiary contractor due for payment,providedyou cooperate.Therefore I am seeking your full and
urgent  assistance for the telegraphic transfer of
this sixteen million and five hundred thousand united
states dollars, us$16,500.000 US dollars to your
designated account for a very good business investment
in your country as due to the instruction my father
gave to me before he late. What I require from you are
as follows.1.Your private telephone and fax number for easy and
strict communication
2.Your bank particular for smooth and successful
remittance of this monies to your nominated account
3.You have to make necessary arrangement for me to
meet with you immediately the monies is been
transferred in your account and confirmed by you.
4.You have to secure a college for me in your country
to further my education. 
5.You will have to be my guardian and part of the
joint venture investment when I get to your country.Furthermore, my late father had instructed me to offer
20 % of the total sum to the person who is to assist
me out for the transferring of this fund.Moreover, I wish to assure you that this transaction
would be concluded within the next(3)days you signify
interest to assist me out.I suggest that this
transaction should be handled in strict confidence
because I have work out fine every modalities
concerning the transfer of this fund. 
Please and please, kindly hasten up the arrangement as
quickly as possible because my late father instructed
me not to invest this monies in this country CÃ´te-
dÂ’Ivoire. That I should invest abroad of my choice for
the benefit of myself and for security reasons.Thank very much in anticipation of your
acknowledgement of this business proposal and do not
hesitate to contact me immediately you receive this
message with this my direct telephone number mentioned

572,0.015,0.933,0.052,0.9982,"sum : ' this ' and ' that ' dear colleagues : last week i sent a query to this list asking you about the fomral opposition between ' this ' and ' that ' in the demonstratives ( june 4 , 6 . 772 , qs : ' this ' , . . . ) . i have received 26 responses by now , and so think it necessary to compile a quick summary today as i will be away from tokyo for more than two weeks starting tomorrow . the original text of my query was as follows : some present-day ' european ' languages have only one set of simple demonstratives and the opposition of ( this ) vs . < that > is expressed by the help of ( here ) and < there > : french ceci ' this ' ce livre-ci ' this book ' cela ' that ' ce livre-l ` a ' that book ' swedish det ha "" r ' this ' den ha "" r bilen ' this car ' det da "" r ' that ' den da "" r bilen ' that car ' estonian see siin ' this ' see maja siin ' this house ' see seal ' that ' see maja seal ' that house ' my sweidish - german dictionary ( stora tyska ordboken ) gives ( der hier ) and ( der da ) as colloquial ( familia "" r , umgangssprachlich ) german forms which conrrespond to ( den ha "" r ) and < den da "" r > , respectively . how common is a demonstrative system like this ? incidentally , japanese has a rather sophisticated three-way distinction here : kono hon ' this book ( you see here ) ' sono hon ' that book ( you see there ) , the book ( under discussion ) ' ano hon ' that book ( you see over there ) ' so i ' m afraid i will have to convince my students that the japanese are extravagant even in the way of using demonstratives . though the last paragraph was intended as an allusion to the way japanese tourists spend money overseas , quite a few people , both japanese and non - japanese , took it seriously and tried to convince me that the japanese language ( sic ! ) was by no means "" extravagant "" because it was not alone in having a three-way distinction in the demonstratives . some even drew my attention to the existence of a language with a five-way distinction . i thank them for the examples of various demonstrative systems they sent me , but this is not the point i wanted to discuss . perhaps i should have stated explicitly that i was interested in the morphology of demonstrative pronouns / adjectives . it is very important that french , for instance , has one basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective , i . e . ( ce ) , on the morph-lexical level , and that the speaker of french may optionally add an element meaning either ( here ) or < there > in order to make finer distinctions ( ce livre-ci , cette table-l ' a ) . in japanese , however , there 's no single basic demonstrative pronoun-adjective like ( ce ) in french : the speaker of japanese must always choose one from the set of three lexically distinct demonstrative forms . this is a big difference , and puzzels many of my students in my estonian syntax class . here are the responses which i think have direct relevance to my interest : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i imagine that your posting was a bit abbreviated , so did not mention the swedish demonstratives denna / detta / dessa and den / det / de , which in any case are grammatically correct but not usual in conversational speech ( "" den tiden , "" "" det aaret , "" "" de fraagorna "" ) . one would expect danish and norwegian to be similar in this regard to swedish , but unfortunately i have little information to contribute . while danish does has both den / det / de and so on plus the option of adding "" der "" ( "" tag den bog , "" "" naer saa du de mennesker ? "" ; "" hvad er det der ? "" , "" jeg tager dem ( der ) "" ) , i ' m not certain whether usage is quite the same , that is , whether the "" den der "" forms predominate as they do in swedish . [ . . . ] certain dialects of american english do use "" this here "" and "" that there , "" as attested by the way schoolteachers warn their students not to use those expressions . they ' re nonstandard and are regarded as uneducated usages , though i suspect that they actually come from older dialects of british descent in which they were acceptable . - - brian white ( bfwhite @ watson . ibm . com ) - - the use of compund demonstratives is indeed common in my own mother tongue , norwegian , and i believe in all ' scandinavian ' languages , ie norwegian , danish and swedish . i feel that it is a feature of colloquial speech , and i would be surprised to find it in ( formal ) writing . in fast speech the distinction between the two demonstratives tends to be lost , at least in my own dialect ( bergen , western norway ) : den her bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( this car ) den der bilen - - - - ) 'd enner bilen ' ( that car ) moreover , norwegian ( and , i believe , swedish + danish ) has the distinctions : den bilen vs denne bilen ( that car vs this car ; masc . ) det huset vs dette huset ( that house vs this house ; neu . ) which seem to correspond closely to this / that in english , and are perfectly acceptable in written and spoken norwegian . - - gisle andersen ( gisle . andersen @ eng . uib . no ) - - as a native speaker , i would not really use ( der hier ) even colloquial , ( der da ) is possible , an would more likely contrast with < der dort > , which implies that ( der da ) goes along with < this > and not with < that > ! but in general : it is always a problem for native speakers of german to acquire the this / that distinction , as we do not draw the same boundaries . maybe , a more formal ( in terms of the register ) would be : ( dieses ) ( this ) and < jenes > ( that ) - - this it at least what i use in translations ( and also what my german / english dictionary advises me to do - but never trust a dictionary ) . actually , we do not use ( jenes ) very much , it goes along with very formal speech and maybe even old - fashioned . - - gertraud benke ( gertraud @ leland . stanford . edu ) - - english colloquially , esp . black eng . vernacular , uses ' this here ' and ' that there . ' ' this book here ' vs . ' this book there ' sounds perfectly normal , while ' this here book ' and ' that there book ' sound mostly like american english from the south-east portion of the u . s . - - tim beasley ( tbeasley @ ucla . edu ) - - you might be interested to know that many dialects of english ( appalachian us , and therefore some british dialects as well ) have a similar opposition to the one you ' re talking about : this here dog that there dog there is more than one demonstrative used , but the "" here "" and "" there "" seem to be relics of some old germanic usage . - - james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) - - in some dialects of british english ( i ' m not excluding other varieties but i do n't know them well enough ) ' this here ' and ' that there ' are perfectly acceptable eg ' look at this here postcard that she sent me ' ' pick up that there bucket ' these are normal in my dialect - - david britain ( dbritain @ essex . ac . uk ) - - there is another funny case . in colloquial english , you can say "" this here x "" and "" that there x "" . in greek , there is "" afto edho "" ( usually pronounced "" aftodho "" ) and "" ekino eki "" ( "" ekinoki "" ) with the same meaning . ( "" dh "" = postdental fricative ) - - stavros macrakis ( macrakis @ osf . org ) - - interestingly , afrikaans , as a dutch - based creole , has developed ' hierdie ' ( litt . ' here-that ' ) for ' this ' , whereas dutch itself has no such system , using simply 'd eze ' for ' this ' and 'd ie ' for ' that ' . - - henk wolf ( h . a . y . wolf @ stud . let . ruu . nl ) - - i am not sure i understand the question correctly , but in italian ( northern italian at least ) you can say questo qui - or - questo qua ( this here ) instead of "" questo "" quello li ' - or - quello la ' ( that there ) instead of "" quello "" these are both colloquial forms . i cannot really say whether they are used in other parts of italy . - - anna mazzoldi ( mazzoldi @ iol . ie ) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - it seems that with a few execptions ( italian dialects , greek ) , the phenomenon seems characteristic of germanic languages and languages that have gone through strong germanic influence ( french , estonian ) . note incidentally that finnish , which is genetically closely related to estonian , is on the japanese side , and that a similar split seems to exist among the romance languages as well . interesting ? the others gave me examples of "" richer "" demonstrative systems . if you are interested in those data , please ask me for a copy of the file which contains all the responses in the unedited form . my hearty thanks to the following people who have responded to my query : philippe l . valiquette ( phlcvali @ vm1 . ulaval . ca ) gertraud benke ( gertraud @ leland . stanford . edu ) brian white ( bfwhite @ watson . ibm . com ) tim beasley ( tbeasley @ ucla . edu ) adriano paolo palma ( pyapp @ sun22 . ccunix . ccu . edu . tw ) james kirchner ( jpkirchner @ aol . com ) eugene loos ( eugene . loos @ sil . org ) murat kural ( izzyfk6 @ mvs . oac . ucla . edu ) derek gowlett ( gowlett @ beattie . uct . ac . za ) jeff allen ( jhallen @ indiana . edu ) merce ( prat @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) nino ( n . vessella @ agora . stm . it ) david beck ( djbeck @ uvvm . uvic . ca ) debra r west / markell ( markell @ afterlife . ncsc . mil ) anna mazzoldi ( mazzoldi @ iol . ie ) stavros macrakis ( macrakis @ osf . org ) gisle andersen ( gisle . andersen @ eng . uib . no ) david britain ( dbritain @ essex . ac . uk ) henk wolf ( h . a . y . wolf @ stud . let . ruu . nl ) kiyoko takahashi ( gc610817 @ netserv . chula . ac . th ) philippe mennecier ( ferry @ cimrs1 . mnhn . fr ) david parkinson ( dp11 @ cornell . edu ) anton sherwood ( dasher @ netcom . com ) ( nebiye . kurtboeke @ arts . monash . edu . au ) kirk belnap ( belnapk @ yvax . byu . edu ) geoffrey s . nathan ( geoffn @ siu . edu ) ( as of 09 : 30 jst june 8 , 1995 ) best wishes kazuto kazuto matsumura kmatsum @ tooyoo . l . u-tokyo . ac . jp - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - institute for cross - cultural studies ( tooyoo gengo ) faculty of letters , university of tokyo hongo 7 - 3 - 1 , bunkyo - ku , tokyo 113 japan tel . + 81 - 3-5800 - 3754 fax : + 81 - 3-5800 - 3740 , 5803-2784 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -",0

"" it does appear that the vernacular progressive preserves the original sense of a - pres , which in fact conforms to expectations based on cross-linguistic study . in standard french , the corresponding expression is aupres . many respondents drew my attention to the "" after ving "" construction of english dialect . h . rogers at uoft informs me that the construction is a perfect and not a progressive ; i have since confirmed this analysis . in addition to welsh , scots gaelic has an "" after ving "" perfect that is the likely source of the construction . apparently the preposition in scots gaelic ( air ) now means "" on "" outside of the progressive construction ( an deigh "" after "" ) . thanks again to all who responded . it was an interesting exercise .",0

license on development branches of ipfilter to prohibit redistribution,
although official releases would still be kept under the old license. 
This policy got up the nose of Theo de Raadt (lots of things do, which
is why OpenBSD exists in the first place), so OpenBSD re-invented the

Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?Baud 1200 7 data bits Even ParityI am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1... which is most of the defaults.USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up.btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.Colin.

Hash: SHA1I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, it looks 
like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the 
Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.  
Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As

( "" gccc "" ) to assist in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at present , vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and audits , the company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis required for listing on a national exchange . here is recent news on the company : malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 2 o , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb : vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software , and patents . following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification ) technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use applications , the company has concluded that the need for application support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the framework which operates such technology . the company has identified several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software , and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element . middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web services and service - oriented architectures . since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system . the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and assets in this current state of constant threat . safe harbor statement : this press release contains forward - looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 ( the "" act "" ) . in particular , when used in the preceding discussion , the words "" plan , "" "" confident that , "" "" believe , "" "" scheduled , "" "" expect , "" or "" intend to , "" and similar conditional expressions are intended to identify forward - looking statements within the meaning of the act and are subject to the safe harbor created by the act . such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward - looking statement . such risks and uncertainties include , but are not limited to , the ability of vinoble to complete the proposed acquisition ( s ) , the results of vinoble ' s due diligence review of the candidate ( s ) , the success of the business of the acquisition candidate ( s ) , including the ability of vinoble to continue to sell the applicable products and the acceptance of those newly designed products by the market , market conditions , the general acceptance of the company ' s products and technologies , competitive factors , timing , and other risks described in the company ' s sec reports and filings . the closing of the transaction will be subject to complete due diligence , inspections , and completion of audited financial statements in accordance to gaap as required by the sec prior to consummation . we believe the speculative near term target price is - $ o . 50 we believe the speculative long term target price - $ 4 . 00 we feel this is our best pick since december of 2004 ! ! please watch this one trade tuesday ! disclaimer : information within this email contains "" forward looking statements "" within the meaning of section 27 a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21 b of the securities exchange act of 1934 . any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions , expectations , beliefs , plans , projections , objectives , goals , assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be "" forward looking statements .

start a shell with a minimal build environment, logged with script. The
prevents this kind of error. Since configure yanks all sorts of ill
documented values from one's environment for use in the build (CC, ARCH,
various LD_* variables) this kind of thing is necessary.Often the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no .profile
for building stuff.Cheers,

667,0.083,0.808,0.109,0.9228," email.  I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed
>> (especially those with multiple email addresses...).
>
> What's the point of multiple email addresses? They're a pain.
>
Ah the great spam debate wages on ...So where's Kragen in this whole mess ;-)Eugen, the reason for multiple email addresses (at least _my_ reason) is
that I like to separate my friends from say, FoRK, from say, my school
accounts, from say my spam box.   I tend to get a veritable buttload of
mail from various sources, and sometimes I don't have a chance to go
through it all.   I have it mostly setup on a filter basis (those friends
that go to the carey@ address do get filtered _generally_ speaking into
the friends box, those fork posts, _generally_ go into the FoRK pile. )  
Its still nice to know that if I need to get someone's response and I
haven't gotten around to putting them into the friends section of my
carey@ address, that I can give them another address (bitbitch, which gets
considerably less traffic) and I can be assured of flagging it down.
When I setup my PC to run BSD and then I can get sendmail or procmail or
whatnot to be a better mail program and  I can spend the time making even
_better_ filters than The Bat! provides for me now, I'll probably change
my mind on the multiple email address thing.   I still like knowing that I
can send the assholes (or undesirable guys I don't feel like dating ;)  to
my @hotmail account.I'm also going to also rescind my prior request not to have a member-only
fork.   As snobby and elitist as a member-only FoRK would be, I'm starting
to feel the pain of the whole spam to bits ratio on fork.   I'd be
willing, multiple email addresses and all, to sign up for a whitelist
provided the system could handle email sent from say cnn.com that was
referenced to my address (say the On Behalf of) emails that a few of us
tend to send.   Does such a system exist?  I'm rather ignorant on the
whole whitelist concept, and I know a few of you are far far more
knowledgable.My half a cent here...: I will be so damn glad when I am done with this whole moving
thing... back on fork when I'm in NH.. :)
Woo hoo!   Law school!)

I am HAJIYA MARYAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State,General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project. The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of USD$35,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director right now, the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$3!
 5,000,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited in another private security company vault within the country. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian. Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website : www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th. june, 2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l proposed a percentage of 3!
 0% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 10
% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address above. l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while await your prompt response. NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l have decided that this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy, remember to include your private Telephone or fax number for easy communication. You can also contact my trusted friend and family attorney,Barrister Aishat Gidado at aishatgidado@go.com or her number 248033044180.

698,0.103,0.815,0.082,-0.6643,"Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over
regulation.The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.
It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over
spending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an
example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending
tons of money on public housing.As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose
both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that
EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty
much anathema to liberal politics.Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much
government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private
replacements, no government regulation) is better than government
regulation itself.And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not
include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a
watermelon.

reports, spy satellites have had 1-meter resolution for many years.Finding an individual vehicle in a city might occasionally be possible
with 1-m images and might occasionally also be worth the money.For small areas you have legitimate access to, it's probably cheaper
to go there with a digital camera and a GPS and take some snapshots
from ground level.  Aerial photos might be cheaper for large areas,
areas where you're not allowed --- or, perhaps, physically able --- to
go, and cases where you don't have time to send a ground guy around
the whole area.--

notably , on the wholesale side , the continental , uk and nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to strength as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this quarter . total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in europe have seen an increase of 172 % in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year . specifically , uk power volumes are up 204 % to 147 twh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 twh in the same period last year . continental gas volumes have grown from 351 bbtue / day in 2000 to 1 , 390 bbtue / day in 2001 - a 296 % increase - and continental power volumes have seen growth of 360 % with volumes rising from 18 twh in the first six months of 2000 to 83 twh for the same period this year . the growth in volumes is not simply limited to the uk and continental markets , however , as nordic power volumes have increased by 153 % from 29 twh to 73 twh in the first half of 2001 . the success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading , however , and abound throughout the business : enron energy services the retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the closing of ees ' first , major "" marquis "" brand energy outsourcing transaction with supermarket giant , j . sainsbury plc . of equal importance , enron direct ' s business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160 , 000 . the success of enron direct ' s business model has translated into the development of new business on the continent in the netherlands and spain and , more recently in north america , with the 2 nd quarter opening of enron direct canada . enron credit a year after enron credit ' s launch , the total life to date notional value of transactions has surpassed $ 11 . 8 billion and in the 2 nd quarter alone , enron credit generated $ 10 . 4 million in ebit . further , more than 20 , 000 readers per week view the enron cost of credit ( ecc ) through independent publications . enron australia with 2 nd quarter power volumes up 177 % from the first three months this year , enron australia is gearing up for a strong growth year . with the development of a physical power position key to expanding enron ' s power trading in australia , work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial pursuit of asset development projects . other businesses undergoing significant expansion this quarter were coal , renewable energy credits and weather derivatives . spain : arcos the arcos asset development project in spain continues to make great progress with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being successfully negotiated this quarter , plus the project achieved another milestone in the permit / government approvals arena with the granting of its water concession in q 2 . uk : etol etol , a long - standing contributor to enron europe ' s earnings , generated yet another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series of deals with chemical giant du pont for supplies at wilton international . the transaction further strengthens enron ' s relationship with du pont , one of etol ' s largest customers , and will extend the current steam and power supply contract through 2010 . enron metals a year after entering the metals business , enron metals has seen increased volumes of 130 % in its merchant and financial trading operations this quarter with volumes up to over 3 . 5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1 . 5 million tonnes in the 2 nd quarter last year . not only has the team seen positive growth in volumes this quarter , but they have increased their share of trading on the lme by 50 % and are making significant progress with project salem - a major it and systems improvement project that will streamline deal capture and risk management for metals transactions . finally , the metals team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten - year origination transaction that , through the addition of smelting assets , will enable the metals team to improve its trading position . the transaction proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of enron ' s trading and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups across enron . looking to the future , we have every expectation that the strong growth we ' ve witnessed in europe for the first half of the year will continue through end 2001 . so , in the words of solomon smith barney analyst , ray niles , when talking about enron ' s european wholesale operations results this quarter , "" europe is kicking butt and it ' s about a quarter of [ enron ' s ] activity , nearly double what it was last year . and , that is a new market that is the size of the us .

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   This year's SIC gets the blame for the 
lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting 
software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product 
demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip 
to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar 
faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged 
e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information 
exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and 
sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, 
is Nick Bradbury's release of 
TopStyle 3.0. 
Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia 
family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing 
roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning 
hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that 
previously defined  TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is 
just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of 
the next two issues.Also in the coming soon category - a GnomeTome on Cold Fusion, written by 
one of Iowa's resident ColdFusion experts (who also happens to be an 
expert on an International level), Kevin Schmidt. Kevin wrote the 
Training From the Source 
book on Cold Fusion 5 and is currently writing a revision for 
ColdFusionMX. The GnomeTome means we'll have a nice pairing of tips for 
both static pages, in the form of 
Dreamweaver tips, and tips on dynamic 
site development with Kevin's tips on ColdFusion.Jake LudingtonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeMAIL
Email 911
http://www.email911.comE-mail remains the killer app of the Internet, despite all the incredible 
artistic efforts by many Web designers. As we all know, e-mail is also a 
source of great frustration and misuse - turning otherwise likeable folks 
into enemies of your inbox defense system. Email 911 aims to educate the 
ignorant, while aiding those of us with a reasonable understanding of 
effective e-mail communication in ways to make e-mail even more useful. 
The newsletters and discussions affiliated with this site should be 
required reading for all corporate users, although home users would most 
certainly benefit as well. For an exceptional look at eliminating junk 
from your inbox, check out the e-book ""What Can I Do About Spam?""Â GnomeTOOLS
ApacheConf v2.0 [1.1MB] W9X/NT/W2K/XP $19.95
http://www.zecos.com/apacheconf/index.htmlConfigure your Apache httpd.conf file in a visual environment instead 
of a text editor. This tool provides a visual representation of all 
configurable options available to Apache admins, offering great 
learning capabilities for newer webmasters, as well as saving time for 
experienced administrators who tire of scrolling through screen after 
screen of configurations. A source view makes manual editing of the 
file easier, by bolding and coloring various configuration directives, 
similar to the way HTML editors mark code. Avoid typos with built-in 
error checking, which provides warnings when invalid directives are 
used.

Making A Commercial Case for Adopting Web Standards
http://www.maccaws.com/Supporting standards and writing good code are often things that the number 
crunchers in a business don't feel are as important, when compared against 
getting the product to as many people as possible in the shortest amount of 
time possible in an effort to generate revenue. Communicating the 
importance of standards and good code can be an uphill battle; after all, 
you're just a programmer, right? MACCAWS aims to make your job easier, via 
an open discussion on the establishment of standards that will make sense 
to the folks who control the bottom line. Their mission is to educate 
business leaders by providing you the end user with tools that will help 
make a case for applying standards to your Web efforts. If you've got a 
voice you'd like to add to their cause, visit them on the Web and help 
  influence the course of Web standards development.Â GnomeBLOG

728,0.064,0.857,0.079,0.7076,"I call PacBell/SBC every two or three months about a recurring problem 
we have at my house:We get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our 
house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years 
and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! Sometimes the 
people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me 
that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the 
account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we 
could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the 
account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years 
and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the 
lines of ""Huh?"" or ""I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please."" And 
eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the 
account representatives and billing people and their managers and their 
managers' managers ad naseum.The outcome of every phone call is that they'll ""look into it"" and fix 
the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when 
it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked 
""Not at this address, please fsck off."" and then eventually call them 
back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to 
the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at 
them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell. 
Then I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which 
they seem all too happy to do.At least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a 
lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.Perplexed,

It should forward to a spam address (where filters get adjusted) and then

  | Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I'm trying to
  | think of a useful use of hard links right now, and I'm a little
  | stumped. There's gotta be some benefit that I'm missing that's
  | immediately obvious to everyone. maybe, maybe not.   yonks ago, I seem to recall dmr saying,
 or at least alleged to have said, something along the lines
 that soft and hard links both make sense in isolation, but
 having both does not.  if this is even close to correct,
 yer in quite good company! there is at least one notable difference, and a host of minor
 ones.  the notable difference is the data always exists (and
 is apriori accessible) for hard links --- there is no such
 thing as a broken link. I use this fact on occasion to ""save"" data, via the well-
 known attack of hard-linking to a supposedly-temporary file
 I want to preserve.  the subsequent unlink(2)ing of the
 ""temporary"" file does not destroy the data.
 
cheers!

0. INTROHello SourceForge.net Users,This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.htmlHow will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.Pat-Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITYSourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
additions include servers hosted by:Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);
http://www.twtelecom.com/University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA)
http://www.umn.edu/CESNET (Czech Republic)
http://www.cesnet.cz/We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and

replies that look like this:  ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
phrases here)"".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume"".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
a problem.  Simply click on the link below.

Dear Friend,
                
We are desparately looking for 100 lazy people
who wish to make lots of money without working.We are not looking for people who are self-motivated.
We are not looking for people who join every 'get rich
quick' scheme offered on the internet.
We are not looking for class presidents, beautiful
people, career builders or even college graduates.
We don't even want union workers or trade school graduates.We want the laziest people that exist - the guys and
gals who expect to make money without lifting a finger.
We want the people who stay in bed until noon.
We want those of you who think that getting out of bed to go
lay on the couch is an effort that is best not thought about.If you meet this criteria, go to this site and join free:http://www.roibot.com/w.cgi?R64190_funprogramIn case you haven't figured it out yet, we want
the kind of people who DO NOT take risks.
If you are the kind of person who will consider doing
something that's NOT a 'sure thing', then do NOT respond.
This is too easy a way to make money
and there's no challenge in it.If you can get to the website, you will be able to see the first home 
business in history that requires no work.  NONE.By clicking on this link and going to

792,0.062,0.849,0.09,0.9587,"broker client louise - - in response to some considerable concern voiced by presto , we are re - evaluating our broker client relationships . i ' m planning to send the following email to each of the desk heads . it is intended primarily to generate feedback from the desks , but my ultimate plan is to shut down the relationships and essentially start over with the desks making the transaction decisions instead of eol . before i launched it , i wanted to get your thoughts . thanks , brad earlier this year , enron executed deals with certain broker ' s which allows the broker to execute transactions for their clients via a broker client which is linked to the enrononline platform . all executions done on broker client are free of brokerage charges . to date , about 80 % of the 3 , 400 broker trades executed on - line have been in the us power segment . the companies that have access to read and execute transactions using the broker client are as follows : apb energy , inc . ( canadian nat gas , canadian power , us nat gas , us power , us coal , us emissions , us weather , us crude , us bandwidth ) natsource llc ( us nat gas , us power , canadian nat gas , us coal , us emissions ) amerex natural gas i , ltd .

Tuesday October 8, 2002
The GuardianEvangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down,"" it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""

Date: Not suppliedAll through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is 
hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival:     Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema     In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been 
    constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric 
    permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies 
    that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers 
    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest 
    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming 
    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce 
    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics 
    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances 
    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the 
    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of 
    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James 
    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary 
    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry 
    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish 
    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, 
    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously 
    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, 
    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to 
    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no 
    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to 
    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Jef[3]!_)[1] http://www.msri.org/20thanniversary/cinemath.html

british columbian government exploring energy issues ? bc hydro readies itself for transmission line sale ? bpa aborts additional rate increase , refutes california ' s overcharge claims bc government the bc liberals have announced that they are putting together a new policy task force on energy to deal with energy issues going forward . they will be looking at the province ' s energy resources and will be making recommendations in less than six months on the best way to move forward . the task force includes : jack ebbels , deputy minister of the ministry of energy and mines , chair peter meekison , energy policy consultant john bechtold , oil and gas expert erik westergaard , hydroelectricity expert brenda eaton , deputy minister to the premier our information is that the policy task force will look seriously at the offshore drilling and exploration issue and begin to determine timetables to start this process . additionally , the canadians are becoming increasingly rancorous over the 19 . 4 % us tariff on softwood timber exports coming to the states . a bc cabinet minister has made veiled threats to tie canadian energy exports to the united states to eliminating the softwood timber tariff . jean chretien himself has backed away from trade war talks , but intimated that reduction or elimination of the tariff will be critical to moving the oil and natural gas pipeline projects in northern bc along . bc hydro bc hydro chair larry bell is soft - peddling the bc liberals ' message of deregulation . coming under intense scrutiny , bell has already gone public to defend bc hydro ' s rate freeze and has stated that residential distribution and powerex operations will not be deregulated . we noticed , however , that he did not say whether or not information technology and transmission assets would be sold off - which appears is indeed going forth . we believe that bc hydro is in the process of preparing to accept bids for its assets and that a round of open negotiations will begin in the short - to - medium term . two big players to watch on the transmission privatization front are : trans - elect corporation , which has indicated it is watching the british columbia market very carefully and already owns the adjacent transmission lines in calgary ; and transconnect , which has been working with the rto - west group , which could eventually plug bc hydro ' s transmission systems into the rto west grid . bell has been talking about instituting a tiered - rate plan for bc ' s own energy - intensive industries , allowing energy - efficient plants to maintain their preferred rate , increasing rates for others . he is considering allowing private sector generators to sell directly to industry in bc . however , bell has not been as hot on "" clean coal "" generation as neufeld , having suggested that he has not yet seen an application of the technology , which has been economically and environmentally sound . strategically , hydro ' s export plans will likely look to include new partners across the border . from what we are seeing of the new chairman ' s position , it appears that bc hydro will attempt to sever the "" feeling of entitlement "" that bc ' s own energy - intensive industries have relied on . that is , hydro is snooping around the states for greener pastures after having had a taste of the california windfall last year . why commit to providing cheap power to local markets when you could be selling the same power for larger profits elsewhere ? bpa financial conditions to everyone ' s relief , bpa last week announced there would be no additional rate increase . in early august the agency had warned that its pre - third quarter review showed a possibility it would have to trigger the financial - based cost recovery adjustment clause ( fb crac ) , one of three cracs bpa and its customers adopted in the supplemental rate case to cope with erratic power prices . the load - based ( lb ) crac has already driven a 46 percent rate increase , and the fb crac could have added another 4 . 5 mills . but the agency said fresh data put its revenues above the trigger , so there will be no additional rate hike . additionally , we have also heard that bpa is still committed to spending roughly $ 186 million next year on fish and wildlife issues . ferc refunds although bpa has not issued an official statement , as a net supplier to california it is likely that bpa would be opposed to california ' s attempt to recoup over $ 1 . 5 billion in perceived overcharges from the pacific northwest . earlier this year , bpa responded to allegations of overcharging by issuing a rebuttal letter entitled "" bpa response to california iso study "" on 13 april 2001 which maintained that its operations were above reproach . bpa will look to pursue an insurance policy to insulate itself from cal - iso ' s allegations . pacific northwest utilities and other energy - using entities , such as the city of tacoma and the port of seattle , also have joined in the fray to pursue $ 2 billion in perceived overcharges . the name of the game on the west coast is to say that you were a net importer , not a net exporter during the period of time that is under investigation by ferc and the federal judge . everyone is beefing up their argument with load data to show they were actually buyers , not sellers . spill issues the power planning council has recommended spending more than $ 7 million for projects designed to mitigate for emergency power operations during this drought year . most of the funding would go to buy up spawning habitat along a tributary of the john day river in oregon , with $ 1 . 6 million to pay for irrigation screens in the yakima river . the $ 7 million is in addition to $ 24 million the council has already recommended to pay for projects designed to offset the emergency hydro operations that nearly stopped the spill program at main - stem dams . bpa had agreed to fund $ 9 . 3 million worth of the council ' s list . other projects recommended include funding the monitoring and evaluation of a salmon production project in the south fork of idaho ' s clearwater river , spending $ 300 , 000 to improve fish passage in a tributary of oregon ' s umatilla river , and installing stream flow gauges in the entiat , okanogan and wenatchee rivers .",0

I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  I actually lived on
a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest
and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my
parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than
I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I
do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand
from my father.The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because
it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it
is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a
consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not
something that was impressed upon them.The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity
that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian
Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a
single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from
tribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the
tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per
person, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of
places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various
businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes
are run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their
share no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very
high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy
take their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the
corporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accounting
purposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one
works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those
dividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because
they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is
that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,
many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white
folk, not Indians.Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also
receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation
to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By
benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other
ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are
ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are
very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good
credentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the
Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has
billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have
gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the
dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular
case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before
drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to
intelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and have
actually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,
there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50
million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal
government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This
particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures
per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many
borrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,
the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand
dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather
than their own pockets.Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable
assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given
where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign
companies.  And the cycle continues.So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a
nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and
gross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during
pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very
substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of
the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the
earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one
reservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of
these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is
arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police
etc).In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a
shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I
have ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren't
that many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I
could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless
you'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but
it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good
guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,
if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as
a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are
openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It
will give you an interesting perspective on things.)There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous
Indians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and
intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is
where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if
they maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal
leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological
cases mentioned above.The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent
by the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high
when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is
just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to
ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The
poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my
original point.
On a tangent:One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal
corporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate
socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this
structure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has
interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well
over the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.It seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasingly
voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western
society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with
the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting
individuals.Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.-James Rogers

*Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case
Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella SoftwareLos Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
of the software does not violate copyright law.Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol.In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software.Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
opportunities for artists.On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

*Electronic Frontier Foundation Holds Second Annual Share-In
John Perry Barlow, Mountain Girl Garcia Host Free Music FestSan Francisco - Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation and five Bay
Area bands for an afternoon of live music and outdoor fun at EFF's
second annual Share-In. The festival will be held in Golden Gate
Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon
- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful
Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of
the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their
performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio
License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set
Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,
celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band
Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including
Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,
Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his
Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel
Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for
Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as
the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in
cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual
technologies.The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to
help artists share music more directly with their fans, without
sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages
collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business
model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free
software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages
artists to share with one another and their fansAdoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their
work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks
or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without
relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music
distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.
The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for
packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies
currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF
is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control
over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.When: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pmWhere: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the

Look at my friend Jonathan's company, VOXEO.  Unless you're going 
to run out and build a platform that executes Voice XML code and 
can support IMAP etc. then the easiest way to do this is to 
leverage VOXEO's service.  You can start building on it for free 
and you will pay > $0.10 per minute for the pleasure of 
using/testing the service.http://www.voxeo.comIf you have about $50K to throw at the project then you can look at 
NUANCE, which has a platform that combines VoiceXML/VXML, Speech 
Reco, and the L&H speech synthesize, which will allow you to have 
your email read to you by Stephen Hawking.TellMe & BeVocal have off-the-shelf services that do this, though, 
but from my testing, they suck.If I were to build this I'd spec a lightweight IMAP client and 
VoiceXML browser and dump them on VOXEO.However, you'll find this to be extremely slow and frustrating.

896,0.064,0.861,0.074,0.9723,"I have translated the article in full - see 
end of post (I think that I've done a far 
better job than the Google translation - at 
least it's readable now - any corrections
appreciated).Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions 
to the debate.My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody 
incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if 
anyone is miffed.The article makes four main points.
1) Absence of critical clauses. 
In this case, the idea is that the licence 
is invalid because it doesn't specify
under what country's law the GPL is governed.
2) Specification in English only.That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), 
the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written 
in French.
3) Arbitary licence change.The point here is that (under French law) the 
author can change the terms of the licence 
arbitarily. This is because any granting of 
rights by an author must be clearly delimited
in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and 
times. In the absence of such limitations, the 
original author has the right to change his 
software back to closed on a whim.
{David Neary makes the point that the copyright 
holder automatically retains the right to change 
the licence.Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from 
all *copyright holders*That's not my understanding. French law allows a 
GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the 
specific conditions of the granting of such
rights are clear - if they are not, there is
nothing to stop the original author taking
back ""his work"". The lawyers see this
(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).}4) Hidden defects.Roughly, this clause means that the author(s) 
is/are liable for any defects if the consumer 
is not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up 
and data is lost, then the authors are liable.
{Ciaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have 
similar clauses - the point here is that they 
are *_all_* invalid - just that this one 
affects the GPL also.Niall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not
a sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement
and that's why it doesn't come under this point.I would suggest that the whole thrust of this
article has been to see software ""sales"" (even
if no money changes hands) as governed very
much by consumer law (in France anyway).
Rick Moen makes the point that it is not
a sale but rather a granting of rights which
are not default. See the bit about even the granting of 
rights by an author having to be 
explicitly specified - under French law.
The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that
the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that 
there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.}5) Roughly.There may be other reasons under French 
law why the  GPL may be invalid.-----  Whole Article. -----------
Freedom(a) is worth more than these 
imperfect licences.
Specialised lawyers look at the GPL.Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to 
the court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both 
specialised in the area of intellectual property 
examine the ""free"" licences and in particular the 
GPL. They have published their study
in the review ""Proprietes intellectuelles 
(Intellectual property)[1]"" and their
conclusion is grim.
Their approach is interesting. The problem for 
them is not to know whether freedom is valid under 
French law (for them the question is a moot point)
but rather they asked themselves about the form 
and the content of the text of free licences, and 
in particular the GPL. The problem is not free 
programmes, but rather the licence contracts of 
free programmes.Absence of critical clauses.The authors tell us that first of all, the 
reference to ""copyright"" is not legally 
sufficient in the framework of international 
contracts  (which is the case of licence 
contracts for programmes developed and spread 
via the Internet). The idea of copyright can 
basically include differences from one country 
to another. This is why, under international 
contracts, it is necessary to specify to which 
laws one is referring (French law, American &c.).The authors only found three public licences 
which were correctly formulated on this point: 
QPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public
Licence).Specification in the English language.Next, the authors remind us that (at least in 
France), no clause in a contract may be contrary 
to French law [2]. However, it turns out that a 
licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law 
in several respects. Firstly, it is written in 
English and the FSF doesn't officially approve 
translations. The ""Toubon law"" obliges this sort 
of contract to be written in French, including for 
businesses since the notion of ""user"" applies not 
only to consumers, but also to businesses, 
professionals &c. 
Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, 
lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as 
far as business is concerned, the ""Toubon 
law"" is probably doomed to change since 
it is in contradiction of European directives 
on the subject, but whatever about that, the 
problem is still valid for individuals, and 
while waiting for it (French law) to change, 
French companies have to deal with it, since 
it is the law of the land.
A programme under the GPL can suddenly 
change licence.
Another problem, much more serious, is 
that according to French law, the author of 
a free programme can, at any time, invoke 
the invalidity of the licence for this 
software by simply changing the licence.
In effect, the law of intellectual 
property stipulates that the granting of  
rights by the author is subordinate to 
the condition that each of these granted 
rights be the object of a distinct clause 
in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and 
that the granting of any such rights be 
delimited with respect to its scope and its 
grantees, and also with respect to its 
location (i.e. where such rights may be 
excersised)  and duration of any such grants. 
[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of
other free licences. Briefly, this means 
that in France, or elsewhere if the author 
is French, that which is under the GPL could 
revert to proprietary from one day to the next. 
 
The problem of the guarantee ""hidden defects"".
An other very serious flaw is that of the 
guarantee. The GPL licences and others show 
that the software is delivered ""without 
guarantee"". You are going to immediately
reply that commercical programmes carry the 
same clause in their licence contracts,
and this is correct. However, whatever is 
written in a licence contract, one cannot
free oneself from the ""guarantee from 
hidden defects"", since it is imposed in the 
Civil Code. This concept is poorly understood 
by the layman, it protects the buyer
(whoever it may be, individual or business, 
since it specifies the Civil Code and not 
consumer protection law) against hidden 
defects, deliberate or made in good faith by 
the seller. 
For example, if one buys a pair of socks 
in a sale, and the shop has a notice 
specifying that ""Sale items are neither 
refunded nor exchanged"", and on arriving 
home you notice that one of the socks has 
a hole in it, several scenarios are possible.
You could have checked the socks before 
purchase: the flaw is deemed ""obvious"" and
you can sing for your money.
You couldn't check the socks (they were 
packaged for example), and in this case, 
despite the notice ""neither refund nor 
exchange"", you may invoke ""hidden defect"" 
and have them changed or obtain a refund, 
it's up to you. Personally, I have already invoked in shops 
the ""hidden defect"" clause and it always 
worked well (shopkeepers are always very 
cooperative if you quote a couple of words 
of the Civil Code). 
The concept of hidden defect is rather 
wide, it is necessary that you hadn't 
the possibility of discovering the defect 
before buying the product and then 
(according to the Civil Code) that you 
wouldn't have bought it at that price if 
you had known about the
defect.
The third case which is much rarer , is 
if you are able to show that the vendor had
knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't 
inform you. In this case, not only does he 
have to reimburse the product, but all 
expenses incurred by the sale (metro 
tickets to go to the shop, the fuse 
which blew when you plugged it in &c.)
This idea of ""hidden defect"" applies to
 all products, including programmes. This 
was made abundantly clear by the 
authorities (and the courts) surrounding 
Y2K. This is particularly inconvenient for 
free programmes, since a site which 
offers a Linux distro for download is 
supposed to provide a guarantee against 
hidden flaws.
LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if 
in the case of a free programme, 
one could speak about a ""hidden"" defect 
since the source code was available, 
he replied ""Actually, concerning the 
guarantee, the question of obvious 
defect will arise. This analyis will 
be different depending on whether the 
person who downloads the distribution 
is an IT professional or not"". OpenSource has this advantage over 
the proprietary programme: it protects 
the distributor against a guarantee of
hidden defect insofar as the buy is an 
IT person. But, for distribution to the 
public at large, the problem remains 
the same.Roughly Speaking.
Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, 
this study is far from being exhaustive 
and many other areas could be explored. During this interview, we asked ourselves, 
for example, about the fragility of the 
GPL clause which forbids linking source 
code under the GPL with proprietary code. In effect, the laws of intellectual 
property give the right to the user 
to modify a programme with the
intention of permitting interoperability 
with another programme. If for that,
I need to link with a proprietary library 
(communication protocol, device driver)
I may consider as ""null and void"" this 
clause of the GPL.
The conclusion of this study is a wake 
up call for the community. ""Freedom"" 
merits more than these shoddy licences, 
which should be modified before court 
cases over them proliferate and put at 
risk the undeniable originality of 
this effort.

Iceland (Sask is a land-locked massive expanse of ultra-flat dust with
only two rivers and farm sizes measured in the

was written back in the days when gcc splintered due to a perception of 
slow progress on the main branch. A number of Linux distributions wound

since the i386 was the CMOV introduced with the Pentium Pro. gcc 2.95 
will use that instruction if directed to with -march=pentiumpro and you 
will generally get a few percent improvement out of it. Code compiled 
with that option will fail on Pentium and earlier processors.> The Pentium also 
> started introducing pipelining so properly generated code can be upto 30% 
> faster than equivulent code that performs the same function!That's the art of instruction scheduling - rearranging the instructions 
generated by the compiler such that they make best use of the parallel 
(""superscalar"") pipelines present in a modern CPU. gcc 2.95 has a fair 
go at scheduling according to the -mcpu=pentium/pentiumpro option. gcc 
3.1 does a better job, and fine tunes for a few more processors such as 
athlon and athlon-xp. They're in the process of replacing the compiler's 
instruction scheduling with a whole new mechanism that should do an even 
better job, but that's a ways down the road yet in gcc 3.3.As for the exotic extra instructions sets, gcc 3.1 will make use of SSE 
or SSE2 instructions instead of 387 instructions if you use the 
-mfpmath=sse option and you may see some speed benefit from it, but 
there's a chance you may also see incompatibilities. gcc will still use 
i387 code for missing functionality in the SSE instruction set (double 
precision floats for example).AFAIK no current gcc will ever use MMX or 3DNOW! instructions though gcc 
3.1 enables user code to explicitly generate these instructions with C 
code. The kernel sometimes uses these instruction sets to get super-fast 
block copies of memory or RAID math but not much else.> Not sure what improvements the P4 introduce? I think it's mostly just speed 
> improvements rather than any execution changes.P4 introduced SSE2, a _MUCH_ improved version of SSE and a viable 
replacement for i387 FPU code. SSE supports only single precision floats 
while SSE2 can handle doubles. MMX and SSE shared registers with the FPU 
which hobbles them a bit, but SSE2 has its own large, dedicated register 
file. So far P4 is the only CPU equipped with SSE2. AMD's x86-64 CPUs 
are said to have it as well. Of course x86-64 itself is a whole other 
ball game...Paul.--

little embeded controller spoke to its DOS (not exactly the easiest
environment to track crashing bugs under) master which logged its
piteous whinings. I inherited the dos part of it and worked mostly on
creating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it
extensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash
out for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my
predecessor's ""add new entries to the end of its linked list"" function
recursively called itself with each following link until the terminating
one showed up. Of course it died miserably when it ran out of stack. I'm
sure he felt he'd done a good days work when he planted that bomb for
me.C.

The flexi-PCB connecting the halves is probably only good for 100,000 flexes too.
(The keyboard is $200-400, hence minor concern.)Kind of useless for keysigning though; is it not law that when you have to sign,
you will be packed and ready to leave/arrive elsewhere?  Thats why F-u-F-mi
is such a handy accessible proxy signing method and Dragon Naturally

	Seriously, the nifty Palm thing where you enter your password

is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting,
for example, or you are selecting a message to display. > It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current

will return an unsorted list of the directory's contents.
But the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun.
Exmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is
already pretty tricky > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
 > context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time,
but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to
check their date stamp, you could just read them again.  Also, now that
we checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change
every time.  In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about
the folder.--

And, BTW, England as well.Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons. First of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper. Second, the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim. It sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling. Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper as the merchant who took the IOU.===========================The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money. The effects are a complete disaster. There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid.So almost all the literature talks about that.But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation. The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada had much effect. And Canada is still a prosperous country. > -----Original Message----- > From: fork-admin@xent.com [mailto:fork-admin@xent.com] On Behalf Of Gary > Lawrence Murphy > Sent: Saturday, September 21, 2002 7:31 AM > To: Mr. FoRK > Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org > Subject: Re: sed /s/United States/Roman Empire/g > > >>>>> ""f"" == fork list writes: > > f> ""Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift > f> whole societies out of poverty"" I'm not a > f> socio-political/history buff - does anybody have some clear > f> examples? > > China?

( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - ) - chonawee short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise . however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up , you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime . let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends , and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as follow if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 , you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position .",0

994,0.038,0.898,0.064,0.9756,"summary : basic order ( and remarks on typology ) last week i asked for references to discussions of a problem that comes up in linguistic typology : when there are conflicting or ambiguous criteria for deciding whether a particular language is a particular ' type ' with respect to some feature ( word order , clause alignment , or whatever ) , how does one decide how to assign that language ? i would like to thank the following for their helpful replies : george huttar , yehuda falk , dan everett , larry trask , jon aske , mike maxwell , mark newson , bill croft , georgia green , ingo plag , randy harris , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy . i was quite surprised at the small amount of published attention that there is to this problem . i was pointed to short discussions ( no more than a couple pages ) in some of the major works devoted to typology : the seminal greenberg paper , comrie 's ' language universals and linguistic typology ' , croft 's ' typology and universals ' , and hawkins ' ' word order universals ' . it was also suggested that i look at doris payne 's ' the pragmatics of word order ' and to papers on yagua by payne and dan everett and on tzotzil by judith aissen . what prompted my query was a reading of johanna nichols ' linguistic diversity in space and time , which i found extremely impressive . but all through it i had an uneasy feeling caused by her pigeon-holeing languages as ' svo ' , ' head-marking ' , ' active-stative ' , or whatever . since so many languages are * not * transparently one particular ' type ' on the surface , i wondered what the basis for these type-characterizations was . there is no general answer given to this question for an obvious reason : neither nichols or anyone else could have profound first-hand knowledge of more than a small handful of the 174 languages in the data base . i suspect that in most cases nichols could not know what criteria were applied to type a language in the sources she consulted , because many sources are insufficiently explicit on that point or take as self-evident some categorization that another would take as controversial or simply wrong . ( consider , for example , her typing french as vso . ) there were , to be sure , cases where nichols threw out some language from the sample of some particular feature because of its obvious ambiguous status with respect to that feature . but doing so could have created more problems than it solved . as both aske and croft pointed out in their postings to me , if a language is ' inconsistent ' with respect to a particular feature , that too is typological data ; data moreover that could be highly relevant to conclusions about stability and diversity over time . in a sample of 174 languages , misassignment of several languages within a category with a 3 - way division could lead to rather different conclusions . likewise , so would postulating a different set of categories or having categories specifically for ' mixed ' types . this is beginning to sound like a critique of nichols , but i do n't mean it to be . rather , it is more a commentary on the shaky art of typological pigeon-holeing that underlies not just conclusions about language prehistory , but also much functionalist theorizing and - - increasingly - - generative theorizing as well . there is also the question of sample * size * . typologists strive , quite reasonably , to correct for genetic and areal biases in their samples ( the most heroic effort along these lines that i know of is dryer 's work ) . but how confident can we be of any attempt to eliminate bias from the sample , given nichols ' conclusions that influences can extend half-way around the globe ? and does n't that present a challenge to purported explanations of the relative frequency of some typological feature , which are common in the functionalist literature and increasingly so in the generative ? so much could be the result of historical accident on the one hand and contact and descent on the other , rather than the product of ' external ' functional forces or the design of ug . the smaller the sample of languages where mutual influence or common descent is not a possibility , the more likely that some implicational typological relation is artifactual . and the more reason we have to think that there are a lot of typologically possible but - - purely by chance - - nonexisting languages . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu ps : with respect to the last point , alan bell has shown that if some feature appears in 1 % of the world 's languages ( say , 40-50 languages ) , it will show up only about 50 % of the time in a random sample of 75 languages . you 'd need a sample of over 200 languages before it could be counted on to show up 90 % of the time . and we are assuming here , utterly counterfactually , that there are no genetic relations or areal influences between languages .",0

1001,0.024,0.918,0.058,0.9504,"re : 5 . 1414 native speaker intuitions i would like to make a few comments on marilyn silva 's questions about control structures like ( 1 ) johnny asked the teacher to go to the bathroom . ( 2 ) johnny asked to go to the movies . which , at least for some native speakers , are acceptable and allow an interpretation with the matrix subject as the controller . i believe that the interpetation of these sentences is fully explainable in terms of speech act semantics ( no syntax needed here ) . first , it is clear that the person asked is a potential agent and that in the "" unmarked "" case the empty subject is also supposed to an agent supposed to perform some future action specified by the verb phrase on the infinitive clause . therefore , the first option is object control . in the case of ( 1 ) this preferential interpretation is overridden by other pragmatic factors , such as the relative social status of the participants ( student vs . teacher ) . it is relatively unlikely ( though not excluded ) that the student will ask the teacher to do something . therefore , it is seems reasonable to look for an alternative intepretation . in the case of ' ask ' = a reasonable antecedent of the understood subject is the the potential beneficiary of the request , i . e . the asker . the asker benefits from the potential action performed by the addressee of the request . johnny could certainly categorized as being the beneficiary of the situation "" going to the bathroom "" . thus it seems plausible to referentially link the empty subject of = the infinitive complement . similarly , for a sentence like ( 3 ) john asked paula to be assigned for the task . which seems to involve control switch , i . e . switch from object control to subject control . in this case the passive construction overtly signals that the empty subject cannot be an agent . therefore , it 's implausible to assume coreference between the empty subject and the matrix object . but both john and the empty subject are potential beneficiaries . well , not beneficiaries not in the sense of case grammar or theta-role theory but in the sense of speech act semantics . what seems to at work here is a principle of "" role identity "" , which has been worked out in some more detail in a recent article written by klaus - michael koepcke and myself in folia linguistica 27 . 57-105 . ( "" a cognitive approach to obligatory control phenomena in english and german "" ) . roles are not understood there in the sense of case grammar but as "" pragmatic roles "" . we also point out some interesting differences = between control in english and german , for example , that sentences like ( 4 ) der polizist bat , den saal zu verlassen . ( literally : the policeman asked to leave the room ) can only be interpeted as involving an "" implicit controller "" , i . e . an addresse or a set of addressees , which is not lexicalized . related issues are also discussed in my recent book "" kontrollph = e4nomene im englischen und deutschen aus semantisch-pragmatischer perspektive "" published by gunter narr verlag , tuebingen . by the way , koepcke and i found that native speaker 's intuitions in these matters are really very unreliable and that linguists should think of more serious ways of testing what is possible in a language and what is not . klaus panther , university of hamburg , germany",0

"" this man , in his official capacity , has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests , "" south asserted . "" he ' s a pure political phony . "" the state renewed ethics attacks put davis on the defensive * politics : the governor ' s conflict - of - interest problems with his energy advisors give gop rival bill jones a ray of hope for his struggling campaign by mark z . barabak , times political writer in 1998 , when gray davis first ran for governor , his republican rival tested a series of attacks on davis ' ethical conduct . there were charges that he improperly used state workers in a previous campaign , accusations that he placed cronies on the state payroll and questions about possible conflicts surrounding davis ' voracious fund - raising activities . but when voters heard the allegations , they simply shrugged them off . the response was , "" he ' s a politician . of course he does stuff like that , "" recalled one gop strategist who sat in on the voter interviews conducted for republican nominee dan lungren . the campaign shelved its line of attack and democrat davis romped to a landslide victory . now he is under renewed assault for alleged ethical lapses , this time surrounding the state ' s electricity crisis . the issue has put the governor and his campaign aides on the defensive just as the state ' s power crunch appears to have finally eased . the charges have also invigorated the struggling campaign of bill jones , the republican secretary of state and davis ' sole declared rival in the race for governor . last week , jones called the conflict - of - interest allegations "" one of the most significant , pervasive and costly "" ethics scandals in california history . but as yet , there has been no evidence of profiteering on the part of davis ' energy advisors , let alone the governor himself . and unless there is some proof , many observers doubt that the revelations will seriously set back the governor ' s reelection prospects in november 2002 . "" i don ' t see this becoming a dominant campaign issue , "" said jim knox , executive director of california common cause , the good government group and one of davis ' most prominent critics . "" it ' s likely that the more resonant issue . . . is going to be how well the overall crisis was resolved or not resolved . "" that said , knox worries that the controversy will only contribute to the corrosive cynicism turned up in lungren ' s focus group interviews . "" the danger is that this could undermine the public ' s confidence in state government ' s ability to resolve this crisis in their best interest , "" knox said . "" it does surprise me that the governor ' s office , with all of its experience and talent , could so cavalierly disregard the state ' s conflict - of - interest laws , which , to me , appears to be what happened . "" the controversy involves nearly a dozen davis administration officials with financial ties to some of the major energy companies doing business in california . their investments surfaced months after the officials should have filed economic disclosure statements - - revelations that resulted , in part , from jones ' pressure . five of them have been fired and others are facing state or federal investigations . garry south , the governor ' s chief political strategist , points to the firings as evidence of davis ' probity . "" clearly , if the governor ' s office did not feel there was a conflict of interest there , they would not have been fired , "" south said . as for others in the administration who may have failed to promptly disclose their ties to the energy industry , "" there is absolutely nothing illegal about anyone on the governor ' s staff - - or anyone in state government - - owning stock in any company whatsoever , "" south said . even so , davis ' top spokesman , steve maviglio , earlier this month sold his 300 shares of stock in a california power company after news of his holdings surfaced . maviglio said he lost $ 1 , 300 in the transaction . at the least , the revelations have been a distraction for davis at a time when he would rather boast about a blackout - free summer . "" it is a mistake that didn ' t need to be made and shouldn ' t have been made , "" said gale kaufman , a sacramento campaign consultant and one of the rare democratic strategists willing to publicly criticize the governor . "" the fact that it took a while to correct it creates an image problem he didn ' t need . "" republicans , of course , see a larger problem . "" he ' s either incompetent or there is corruption within his administration , "" said rob stutzman , a spokesman for the california republican party . "" and we think it starts with the tone and example he sets with those who work for him . "" in characteristically pugnacious fashion , the davis campaign has sought to turn jones ' charges around by accusing the secretary of state of exploiting his public office for political gain . "" this man , in his official capacity , has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests , "" south asserted . "" he ' s a pure political phony . "" but jones said political oversight falls well within his purview as the state ' s chief elections officer . "" for the governor ' s office to say that i don ' t have any jurisdiction in this area or shouldn ' t be able to speak to it is patently false , "" jones said . new life for jones ' campaign whatever his stake , there is no question that the attention has given life to jones ' campaign while he is fighting desperately to sustain his gubernatorial bid . the $ 960 , 000 in contributions that jones reported for the first six months of the year is embarrassingly small by california standards , and the bush white house has all but formally endorsed rival richard riordan , who is still exploring the race . ( fellow republican william e . simon jr . , a los angeles investment banker , has been campaigning for governor for months but has yet to officially declare his candidacy . ) but ironically , for all jones ' efforts , it may be riordan who is best able to capitalize on the ethics controversy . unlike simon , a political neophyte , and jones , an 18 - year officeholder , riordan had a decades - long business career before serving two terms as los angeles mayor . "" he ' s cut from a different cloth , "" said don sipple , a gop strategist who is neutral in the governor ' s race . "" if this serves to remind people that politics is a slimy game , riordan can point to the fact he didn ' t start public service until he was more than 60 years old . "" but even while insisting that davis did nothing wrong , strategists say voters will make a careful distinction between the governor ' s professional conduct and any evidence of personal enrichment . and davis ' best defense , they argue , is his famously modest lifestyle - - a frugality symbolized during his 1998 campaign by his cramped west hollywood home . if anyone thinks davis has used his office to get rich , one advisor said , "" all [ wife ] sharon has to do is throw open the door to their condo .

Date: Thu, 26 Sep 2002 00:18:04 GMT""rssflowersalignright""A productive thread[1] on RSS-DEV confronts the 
negativeness about RSS 2.0[2] head-on. This will go someplace interesting.  I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, 
patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other 
words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they 
can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. 
We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. 
So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all 
advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when 
I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did 
it, you can too.[1] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/4032

If u choose Setup NT from the installation CD it will reboot your system

I did this the other night, with the check MBR option, but it didn't 
overwrite the MBR like it should (apparently). Either my disk is completely

( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum",0

	When I do that, it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window
(probably trying to center it on the off-screen window in question.) 	I'll have to try it with another window manager and see if I can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries. I don't have this
problem with any other windows, though. Just the exmhunseen window.Pat_______________________________________________

Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
currently :
1. Leave your current kernel as-is
2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm
3. Rebuild and install resulting packagesDrivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general
case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-)Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.MatthiasPS: Yes Chris, I'm worried about not giving you too much work! Less in fact
since you can easily answer ""freshrpms.net!"" to people asking how to play
DVDs, right? ;-))))--

HOME-MAILERS NEEDED!
  
$300-$1000 PLUS WEEKLYSimple, pleasant work...you do at home.
  
  
Dear Friend,
  
Are you seeking a rewarding second income? Would you like to set your
own work schedule? Work the hours you choose? Earn extra income for
your family? If so, then we may have the answer. Current statistics show
that by the year 2010, 40-60% of the American work-force will be working
from home. Get a jump on your future and secure a job through us. Our
company provides a service to thousands of people and businesses across
the United States. With your help, we can reach and provide a better
service to more of these people and businesses, faster and at a lower cost
than our competitors. We handle a marketing program called the
Home-Mailers Program, which consists of envelope processing and mailing.
These positions require no special skills or experience, just a sincere desire
to GET STARTED, and EARN MONEY!
  
  YOU CAN EARN GOOD MONEY!!!
  
   Potential incomes range from $300 to $1000 weekly or more. Pay rate is
based on a $2.00 per envelope basis. The average Home-Mailer
stuffs anywhere from 150 to 500 envelopes a week, depending on the
amount of free time they have available. The envelopes you process will
make you a substantial income. You'll find this work, done easily and
quickly, can double or even triple your income. With just one or two hours
per day you will be excitedly surprised at how easy we've made it and how
profitable this work actually is. You can earn enough money working in
your spare time to purchase that new car or boat you've been wanting,
pay off credit cards, bills, or even take a vacation. Maybe just add more
financial security for yourself or your family. Whatever the reason, you can't
go wrong.
  
  ALL BUSINESS CAN BE DONE RIGHT FROM YOUR OWN HOME
  
  You can start the same day you receive our materials and begin receiving
money within a matter of days. These positions require no prior experience
or special skills. Under contract you will receive everything you need to
get you up and running as fast as possible. Paychecks are mailed out every
two weeks on the 1st and 16th of the month.
  
  HELP SOLVE YOUR MONEY PROBLEMS
  
   If you are looking for an excellent extra income to relieve financial
pressures, you owe it to yourself to investigate this program. Naturally, no
company can afford to send out costly materials to everyone who writes in
asking for it. Therefore, we must ask each applicant for a one time
application processing fee of $27.00. This fee covers processing and
materials you will receive upon your acceptance and is returned to you
with your first paycheck. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with our company as a Home-Mailer. We will not ask or require
you to pay us for any additional information, instructions, or materials to
stay with us, and stay with us as long as you desire. If for any reason you
are not accepted into the Home-Mailers Program, your processing fee will
be sent directly back to you. There is no hassle. However, you must act
promptly. At this time we are in need of dependable Home-Mailers in your
area, of whom may start in the very near future. There are only a limited
number of positions needed for each region of the country and as soon as
we have enough people to complete the mailing needs in your area we
will not be offering any more applications. We need your help now! So if
you're a productive, positive person we're looking forward to working with
you.
  
  SIMPLE, EASY, AND PROFITABLE, THIS PROGRAM IS THE BEST
  WAY TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT INCOME AT HOME.
  
  If this sounds like something you might be interested in, read on. If not,
thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.
  
  
Sincerely Yours,Ron M. Jenkins

  Because we are a company recruiting people from the public we must
assure you that we are the BEST company to work with and that we provide
the MOST PROFITABLE income. Because we require an initial fee to get
started, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.
This fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time
it takes us to get you started. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with the Home-Mailers Program. We know that current Home-
Mailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their
testimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue
our success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials
received from Home-Mailers:
  
  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity
  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along
  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is
  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes
  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us
  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!
     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL
  
  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble
  making ends meet at my present employment. But
  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was
  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the
  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well
  deserved vacation.
     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA
  
Why do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more
expensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square
foot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +
taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,
multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants
and more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!
Your role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an
employee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer
medical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many
other aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business
expenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of
personal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can 
be done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you
receive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a
steady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior
experience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who
want to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher 
expenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn 
money doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help 
people cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers
Program has been perfected so that it has become one of the most 
successful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the
world with excellent primary and secondary incomes. We invite you to take
part in our success. The money you earn is up to you. We do not require 
that you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. You can take on
whatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop
whenever you want, there are no obligations. There is no need to do any
door to door selling or phone soliciting. You may work in the comfort of your
own home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. No need to leave
your present job. Form workshops with your friends or get the whole family 
to join in. The possibilities are UNLIMITED!
  
  DUE TO COMPANY EXPANSION
  YOUR SERVICES ARE NEEDED NOW.
  Thank you, and we're looking forward to working
  with you, together in the future.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
By Michael E. AngierThis is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to 
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear 
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be 
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.
1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and 
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of 
my book, then write in my journal.9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, 
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.Bonus Step: Make something work better -- 
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

no    19%Comments:
~~~~~~~~~No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com 
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it.
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly
imagine.
3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.
4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.

entertaining--preferably all three.
6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.
7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.
8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of
my book, then write in my journal.
9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful,
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.
10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.
Bonus Step: Make something work better --
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

No. This is a funny thing to me.Â  I hear about so many
people being super scared to give out their SS#.Â  Well folks,
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.Â  Give me a name and address
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.
We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.Â  They could do
who knows what with the CC number.Â  I once had a person
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that
person (me) would have her account info and could write
a check out for thousands of dollars.Â  I told her to just send
it to me then and she said that was OK.Â  Then I asked her
to tell me what the difference was between the original check
and a fax copy.Â  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.Â 
Never
heard back from her.
The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is
available in many places.Â  Have a good day.

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most
importantly, never give any personal information at a site
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar
or a Veri secure sign or others.
Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put
in my credit information in each time instead of having
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner
was in a bad car accident.Â  I had a full service account.
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address
went unprotected.Â  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees;
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com
address to a porn shop.Â  Thus, I lost 4 years of building
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place
on 8 more.Â  This set me back about 4Â  months: I believe I
lost a minimum of $50,000.
Â 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.Â  The first
time I lost almost 4 months of work.Â  Now, I back up often
enough to not to lose so much time.Â  This is also Internet
theft.Â  These people are nothing but out and out criminals
and should spend years behind bars.
Â 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft;
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.Â  I sell only by
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

"" nor - - and this is the problematic area - - can we check claims about anyone 's or any institution 's decisions , opinions , or conduct . we will make every effort to ensure that any such posting has professional relevance , is temperate in phrasing , and ( if at all possible ) does not mention names . we also try not to publicize controversies having only personal relevance , since we do n't want linguist to become simply a forum for private grievances . but more than that we can't do . * about more widespread grievances : we have gotten many protests about cutting off discussions that criticize specific schools of linguistics . our problem with some of these has been that the criticisms were anecdotal , ( sometimes ) devoid of academic content , and sounded personally aggrieved ( see above ) . also , adherents of the schools under attack were telling us they no longer felt welcome on the list . so - - not wanting linguist to become a grievance forum or a cause of unnecessary divisiveness in the discipline - - we cut off the discussions . but we admit that there are good arguments on the side of free speech . so we have decided at least not to cut off discussions abruptly . instead , we will warn "" next - to-last posting on x "" before we send out a "" last posting "" message . and we will post any responses on x received in the interim . also , we 'd like to reiterate that any discussion that could compare schools or theories and stick to the academic issues would be very welcome . we are not committed to protecting any school from _ scholarly _ criticism ; and , in fact , we would tell any protestors that this is a discussion list , and if they feel attacked they must defend themselves through discussion . * about civility : we never intended to become a kind of electronic miss manners , and , frankly , it often feels like a very strange role for your uncouth moderators . however , we ' re committed to keeping postings civil in tone because ( 1 ) more than one academic list has ( literally ) gone down in flames - - i . e . , the list has disbanded because the discussions got too personal and heated ; and ( 2 ) , as much as possible , we 'd like everyone - - not just the brave or foolhardy - - to feel comfortable entering a linguist discussion . so we do occasionally return postings with a request that the writer revise toward a less-inflammatory tone . ( we realize , of course , that what is / is not inflammatory is a judgment call ; and our judgment may be wrong . ) however , we have returned very few postings ; and - - interestingly - - we have never received anything but cooperation from the writers . * * * * * * so - - as we ' ve said before - - we think linguist subscribers , all 5700 of you , are a remarkably reasonable , tolerant , and generous set of people . if you have comments or suggestions about the editorial policies we ' ve sketched out above , we would like to hear them . have a very happy new year ! - helen & anthony",0

Indeed - that I actually had understood prior
to all this - for example commercial entities
with trial/limited/crippled editions. Which is no problem - I don't see why that should
be a problem for SuSE though - surely the 
more the merrrier as far as they're concerned.

One can suspect what one likes. What I didn't 
understand was that SuSE had proprietary 
extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow
people to use under the GPL or even under  a
FreeBSD style licence.
I thought that the model for the likes of 
SuSE was selling support and customisation, 
rather than what I thought of as the core
""product"". I thought that the likes of Yast
came under core - maybe it worked in the glory
days before, say, 2001 - I can understand that
they might want to make more money, but the way
in which they have done it, seems to me, to be 
be against the spirit of the GPL.

could be received for the cost of the media plus
a token of one's appreciation (the latter being
subject to agreement between the parties) - I was
offering a bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two
and a chat for a copy - I don't know what the going
rate is.
If I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a
different issue, and one for which I would be
willing to pay.

I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll

I have now realised this, thanks to your kind
explanations. I can borrow them, but not 
copy them? That's fine - IMHO, it goes against
the spirit of the GPL though.

And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence
terms on, say, trials for commercial company x
to which I object, it is the way SuSE appears, 
at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have
mixed up proprietary and open stuff.

And I have no problem with people sticking trial
editions along with GPL'ed stuff. Why you 
can't pass those on though, is beyond me.

( we may need to examine in detail some typical areas , such as commonsense reasoning , and natural language processing ) * is there psychological and / or biological evidence for existing models ? if so , what is it ? e . open research issues : * can we now propose a common terminology with precise definitions for both approaches to connectionist-symbolic integration and for the location on the continuum ? * how far can unified systems go ? can unified models be supplemented by hybrid models ? can hybrid models be supplanted by unified models ? * limitations and barriers faced by both approaches * what breakthroughs are needed for both approaches ? * is it possible to synthesize various existing models ? workshop format - panel discussions - mini-group discussions : participants will break into groups of 7 / 8 to discuss a given theme ; group leaders will then form a panel to report on group discussions and attempt a synthesis with audience participation - interactive talks : this is a novel type of oral presentation we will experiment with . instead of a classical presentation , the speaker will present a problem or issue and give a brief statement of his personal stand ( 5 min ) to launch discussions which he will then moderate and conclude . - classical slide talks followed by q / a and discussions . workshop co - chairs : frederic alexandre , crin - cnrs / inria - lorraine ron sun , the university of alabama organizing committee : john barnden , new mexico state university steve gallant , belmont research inc . larry medsker , american university christian pellegrini , university of geneva noel sharkey , sheffield university program committee : lawrence bookman ( sun laboratory , usa ) michael dyer ( ucla , usa ) wolfgang ertel ( frw , germany ) limin fu ( university of florida , usa ) jose gonzalez - cristobal ( upm , spain ) ruben gonzalez - rubio ( university of sherbrooke , canada ) jean - paul haton ( crin - inria , france ) melanie hilario ( university of geneva , switzerland ) abderrahim labbi ( imag , france ) ronald yager ( iona college , usa ) schedule : - the submission deadline for participants is february 1 , 1995 . - the authors and potential participants will be notified the acceptance decision by march 15 , 1995 . - the camera-ready copies of working notes papers will be due on april 15 , 1995 submission : - if you wish to present a talk , specify the preferred type of presentation ( classical or interactive talk ) and submit 5 copies of an extended abstract ( within the limit of 5 - 7 pages ) to : ron sun department of computer science the university of alabama tuscaloosa , al 35487 rsun @ cs . ua . edu ( 205 ) 348-6363 - if you only wish to attend the workshop , send 5 copies of a short ( no more than one page ) description of your interest to the same address above . - please be sure to include your e-mail address in all submissions .",0

     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Things You'll Never Hear A Man Say...1. I just love how Barry Manilow sings, don't you?
2. No, I don't want another beer. I have to work tomorrow.
3. You know, her breasts are just too big for my liking.

6. Sure, honey! I'd be happy to discuss the state of our 
   relationship.
7. We haven't been to the mall for ages. Let's go shopping and 
   I can hold your purse.

24. Don't pick that up, I got it.
25. Happy Anniversary!
26. Hey, isn't today your Mother's birthday?

50 TIPS TO MAKE WINDOWS MORE USEFUL 
Do you have to deal with Windows on a daily basis? Might as well 
maximize your time with it. You'll find that some of these tips 
will apply to other operating systems, too. The world of computing 
isn't so mysterious once you understand how it works. With this 
GnomeTome, you'll begin to work faster - and smarter. 
Download Windows Productivity Tips now!  I did a lot this weekend, but I didn't really get much done, 
ya know? My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of 
the basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only 
made it as far as the kitchen. Then I stripped and painted 
the floor where that collection of stuff was previously 
stored, and erected some shelving so I'd have room for more 
stuff. I woke up the next morning discover a very sick 
ferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next 
room over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the 
migration of bad air. So, I ended up dismantling the ferret 
cage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I'm sure 
it's safe. Thankfully, all critters are doing well now.I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws 
with stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that 
the ones I picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped 
out heads and bent shafts. That project stopped after barely 
getting started. The front steps are also in need of rust-
proof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so I 
moved the tools to the other side of the house. Two-thirds 
of the way through the first row, I found that the extra 
1/2"" on the screws I purchased was too much and I began 
running into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. 
Figures. Live and learn. Oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. 
Back down to the basement I went to geek out instead. 
Roughly an hour into geekitude, I glanced over and realized 
it was 78.7 degrees in the basement and I was virtually 
stuck to my chair from the sweat. I shut off as much as I 
really could and still work on a couple of projects, but it 
didn't help the heat situation much. It was just too hot 
outside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added 
heat from the computers. That left me in need of a shower 
and with only the notebook in the living room for the 
balance of the weekend. I cleaned out a lot of ancient 
email, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished 
otherwise. Boy, am I tired. And the weekend is so far away.Hey, the second season of M*A*S*H comes out on DVD 
tomorrow! That should put me in better spirits. I could 
watch M*A*S*H for hours on end. In fact, I often do just 
that. The only kink is that the episodes don't play back-to-back 
from DVD. I'm going to play with AppleScript on the Mac 
to see if I can customize how the individual discs play. In 
theory, I should be able to make a disc play all the way 
through. If I succeed, I'll be sure to share the script 
technique in the AppleCore newsletter. Too bad I can't do that with a stand-alone DVD player.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Randy NielandÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GnomeNETWORK
Slow File Save Dialog Boxes
Pointed out by Ian Hargreaveshttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q321126
I've hated this one for a long time, and now we have a 
hotfix and a workaround, so take your pick as to which will 
work best. I often map drive letters to specific network 
shares, and if I happen to have a system turned off, I'll 
notice a significant delay when clicking the drop-down boxes 
in Open, Look In or Save In/As dialog boxes. Windows 2000 
attempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you 
the list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped 
and how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take 
eons just to save a file. A workaround is to use the My 
Network Places functionality instead of mapping drive 
letters. Fine for some, but I prefer having drive letters 
mapped for many things, being that I work at a command 
prompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. 
Alternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to 
contact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you 
choose.

Customized 9x/ME Blue Screen Errors
http://www.vsres.com/blscrn/
We've all seen 'em. Those annoyingly incoherent blue 
screens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide 
no real help in solving the problem. If you're a programmer 
that has had to deal with error conditions produced by 
Windows 95/98/ME, then this might be a better way to handle 
them within your applications. Blue Screen v1.21 is an 
ActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error 
functions, but provides a way to pass along text and 
response options you designate. Note that this is not 
functional on Windows NT/2000/XP, which handle system errors 
in an entirely different manner.Gamers Beware of Intel 845G Chipset
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513
Discount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when 
reading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. 
The Intel 845G chipset and P4 Celeron processors really 
don't provide an acceptable gaming experience. Not only is 
performance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also 
looking to be a serious matter. Intel has never claimed that 
Celerons were high-end desktop processors, but they have 
typically provided a decent enough experience that they can 
make for acceptable machines for the more budget-minded 
consumer. The compatibility issues with this particular 
version of Celeron and the 845G chipset are something to 
watch out for. Once the Celeron is moved to the .13 micron 
core, I suspect the performance concern won't remain, but 
the 845G alone seems to have it's own problems without 
adding the Celeron misery. The lesson in knowing what 
hardware you're buying is what's important here.Â GnomeALERTZ

Test Drive Compaq Servers
http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/
Compaq (Ok, HP) offers a set of servers running various 
*nix operating systems, as well as Oracle 9i, for test 
drive. Just register for an account and you can tinker 
around with Linux, FreeBSD or even Tru64 Unix running on an 
Alpha server, but without the hassle and expense of 
obtaining your own toys. I love the idea of having a pre-
configured environment that lets you kick the tires without 
causing any permanent damage.

Too Cool
http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102779,00.asp
This was just too interesting not to mention. Water-cooled 
systems are all-the-rage among overclockers and those 
that seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer 
systems. Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and 
applying the concept where it's truly needed - notebook 
computers. Believe me when I say that these suckers get very 
hot. I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and 
I have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my 
own little heat stroke. Fans and the mini water cooling 
system Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat 
mitigation efficiency, but without the noise. The concept of 
a water-cooled notebook sounds a little odd, but I would 
welcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open 
arms.

   hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
   characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.I should have finished this off.3) Keep hitting space to loop thru all the folders that match 
   the characters you typed.  Hit return to actually select the

particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.

Not.Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.

I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for
courses.

1231,0.098,0.788,0.114,0.6004,"Hi everybody!I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database 
access with postgreSQL).This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a 
framework for other web applications.The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the 
database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for 
encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), 
and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not 
the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the 
database, but the database is accessible from the web application. 
Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the 
database password, I can use a different database with different 
user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.Where I can found good documentation about this topic?There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I 
thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. 
After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to 
learn methods and technics.First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so 
I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach 
could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user 
(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the 
nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory 
or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in 
the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small 
bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source 
is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the 
db connection/password to the main web application.In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in 
shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user 
account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your 
provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java 
application (that means, really, another server running in the 
background).Any suggestions?Thank you,
Mario Torre

1237,0.024,0.89,0.085,0.9976,"oil just hit record high , profit from delek - dlkr . ob oil for america has been successful in locating the reefs 33 out of 33 times ! delek ' s main project involves exploring for the mississippian aged lodgepole carbonate build - ups in the williston basin of montana and north dakota , as well as the hardeman basin in west texas . a new exploration technique is being applied to this play , which has proven succesfull . the lodgepole limestone was deposited in a very shallow ancestral williston basin . the carbonate formation was developed as thousands of small , circular limestone build - ups , or reefs . the average distribution of the build - ups is about 4 reefs per square - mile section . the lodgepole reefs were deposited within a fairway a thousand miles long and thirty miles wide on the shelf of the williston basin . the reservoirs in the williston basin may produce as much as 2 , 000 barrels per day ( bopd ) at depths of 7 , 500 to 9 , 500 feet . the most prolific reefs have each produced as much as 4 , 000 , 000 barrels of light , sweet oil . the lodgepole reefs are visible in surface outcrop in the far western part of the williston basin . this allows the sense of scale and geometry of the reefs can be observed first hand . delek resource ' s technology partner in this play is a company named oil for america ( ofa ) . ofa has applied a proprietary photo - analytical program known as all remote sensing analysis . this analysis detects the location of waulsortian reef cores . this program produces well - defined images that correlate with the oil producing wells . oil for america ' s first partner , conoco who was the major player in the lodgepole reef play , stated that the lodgepole reefs are the most economic production it has anywhere in the world . the average well in the united states produces a few barrels per day . each one of these lodgepole wells is so prolific that it amounts to a thousand of those wells . because each well may produce 2000 bod and 4 , 000 , 000 bo cumulatively from a single well - bore , well in excess $ 100 , 000 , 000 of revenue may be generated from a well in a relatively brief period of production . the potential for significant new discoveries in the williston basin began in february 1993 . from a wildcat well near dickinson , north dakota , conoco tested a heretofore non - productive interval in the lodgepole limestone . the carbonate zone had good porosity and gas shows , so after failing to find pay in their deeper objectives , a production test was reluctantly taken at 9 , 721 - 9 , 850 feet . the discovery well , dickinson lodgepole unit # 74 , initially produced at a rate of 419 bopd . the well has produced nearly 2 million barrels of 41 . 4 api gravity sweet crude oil and 1 . 2 bcf of natural gas to date . this discovery ignited a frantic race between 1993 and 1997 where major and independent oil companies attempted to develop and expand the lodgepole find using conventional 2 - d and 3 d seismic programs . the best wells flowed up to an allowable rate of 2 , 000 bopd . the conoco dickinson lodgepole # 75 is the single most productive well , having produced 4 , 000 , 000 barrels of oil and nearly 2 bcf of gas since september 1993 . this well still produces thousands of barrels a month after more than nine years of production . during this time , the lodgepole reef play became the largest onshore play in america . this success , however , was not without failure . the ability to seismically delineate discrete reefs has been very difficult and misleading . the geophysical characteristics of the lodgepole limestone are nearly identical with the overlying carbonate beds . this creates very poor acoustic contrast between the formations , so seismic differentiation between the formations is difficult . as a result , by 1996 the search for additional lodgepole reefs had stalled . the play was recently revitalized when continental resources made another accidental discovery in december 2000 in valley county , montana , 155 miles northwest of dickinson , north dakota . in this area the lodgepole reefs are shallower at 7 , 200 feet . this reef initially produced at 2 , 000 barrels per day , but has now begun producing water . it appears that the well was drilled on the flank of a reef , close to water . the discovery dramatically increases the exploratory opportunities for future discoveries in the lodgepole . oil for america has been successful in locating the reefs 33 out of 33 times ! , and has now begun using another technology to differentiate reefs that show signs of hydrocarbons , as to minimize the possibility of drilling a reef that would be a dry hole , and is confident that the three technologies applied overall makes the chances of drilling a successful producing reef excellent . using these technologies delek will drill those targets in the williston basin . delek intends to raise money , and acquire producing properties in the near term . the properties would complement the exploration as it will be in the same areas as the exploration the company is pursuing . symbol : dlkr . ob keep an eye out for upcoming breakings news !

""The Letter"" $5.00 Paypal Program"" that has been seen lately 
on 20/20 and OPRAH WINFREY...etc... How would you like 
to generate more income through a different avenue? What 
if it took only an hour to set it up? Even if you are already in another 
program, stay with it, but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. 
There 
is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE;- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A FEW
THOUSAND DOLLARS REALLY FAST, THEN THIS PROGRAM I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH 
YOU 
IS THE WAY TO DO IT! IT'S THE FASTEST, EASIEST PROGRAM YOU WILL EVER DO!!!Here's something which (I trust) will be of interest
to you! Please read all of this. This is not something 
that I would normally look at, except that I read an 
article in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about 
PayPal and, when I came across this concept I knew it 
would work because, as a member of Pay Pal, I had
already experienced their efficiency and good standing. 
You can complete this whole process in one hour and you 
will never forget the day you decided to do so!!! Oh! 
Did I say FAST? By fast I mean 'the speed of the 
Internet-type fast.' Everything is done on the
Internet by E-mail.NEED PROOF? Here are just two testimonials from
individuals who decided to invest nothing more than a 
little of their time.TESTIMONIALS FROM:Tony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:
Hey! I got your e-mail! YOU ROCK! I sent it to all of
our frat brothers.....and while I haven't seen my $20 
grand yet, I'm up to $8,285. Hook me up when you run 
this program again........Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC:
Hey cuz! This is Mary. I only have one thing to say to
you... OH MY GOD! I sent 20 e-mail's out like you said 
and went on vacation. When I got back, my account was 
up to over $12,000! I owe you!GETTING STARTED.If you're not already a user, the very first thing you
need to do is go to PayPal and sign up. It takes two minutes 
and PayPal will deposit $5.00 in your account. That makes this 
program FREE!Here's the link:https://www.paypal.com/refer/pal=larryspaypal%40yahoo.comBE SURE TO SIGN UP FOR A PREMIER (FREE) ACCOUNT! OR YOU'LL BE LIMITED TO 
$100 
DOLLARS ONLY!!! YOU WILL MAKE MUCH MORE THAN THIS!!!Then...... E-mail $5.00 from your PayPal account ($5.00 free) 
to the FIRST name on the list (No.1) along with a little note
like ""Please add me to your mailing list."" BE PREPARED TO GET
EXCITED.... YOU 
WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Don't laugh! Try this while you wait for the 
others 
to start working. One hour of work to get started - no mailing lists. No 
printing, copying or waiting and the concept is 100% legal (refer to US 
Postal and 
Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, 
Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of Federal 
Regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a 
product or service must be exchanged for money received). Here's How It Works. Unlike many other programs, this 
THREE LEVEL PROGRAM is more realistic and much, much
faster. Because it is so easy, the response rate is VERY 
HIGH, VERY FAST-Internet E-mail FAST-and you will see 
results in just two weeks or less! JUST IN TIME FOR NEXT 
MONTHS BILLS! You need only mail out 20 copies (not 200 
or more as in other programs). Ideally, you should
send them to people who send their programs to you or to 
personal contacts who are already working on the web, 
because they know these programs work and they are already 
believers in the system! Besides, this program is 
MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! Even if you are already 
in 
another program, stay with it, but do
yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and will only cost $5.00 max. It will pay off long 
before others even begin to receive letters! Just give ONE 
person a $5.00 gift (REMEMBER THOUGH, this $5.00 is the $5.00 YOU GET 
WHEN 
YOU SIGN UP FOR YOUR new PayPal account). That's all! If you already have 
a 
PayPal account and do not receive the $5.00, feel free to donate a $5.00 
GIFT 
to
the person in the No.1 spot and add your name on the list 
at No.3 position having moved up the remaining two. Follow 
the simple instructions and in two weeks you will have $20,000 
in your bank account!Because of the VIRTUALLY ZERO INVESTMENT, SPEED and HIGH PROFIT 
POTENTIAL, 
this program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! All from just one $5.00 
transaction that you get from PayPal!!!Follow These Simple Instructions: E-mail the $5.00 from your Paypal account to the FIRST 
name on the list (No.1) along with a note saying 
""subscribe me to your mailing list"". Only the first 
person on the list gets your name and $5.00 gift. Edit the list, removing the FIRST (No.1) NAME FROM THE LIST. Move the 
other

"" we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . "" dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book . straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no . although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months . the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure . the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . "" it ' s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk , i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it ' s a tough call that requires strict , individual discipline . there ' s an irony to this whole story , especially in enron ' s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign , enron , looking to challenge conventional wisdom , asks the simple question , "" why ? ask why .

"" my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of proportion . "" news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s stock and bond prices . enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said . the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market , to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said . "" clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , "" mahoney said . the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its default . it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on occasion , foley and doot said .

gas pipelines . that allowed enron to move debt associated with those projects off its books . the affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money . they plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets . enron might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and the debt . that could amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion if the assets don ' t generate any money , a remote possibility , the company has said . few answers investors and analysts pressed enron chief executive officer kenneth lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a conference call tuesday . today , enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to questions about one of them , es power 3 llc . texas records list 78 enron executives and employees as officers , directors and managers of es power 3 llc . the entire enron board is also listed . shares of enron $ 1 . 15 to $ 15 . 20 in late trading . -

- enron corp . , facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into partnerships run by the former chief financial officer , remains a target of investigations and lawsuits in california . california lawmakers and regulators have accused power providers of manipulating the state ' s energy market to raise prices . enron , the biggest energy trader , and other power sellers have denied the charges repeatedly . next month , a california senate committee investigating the power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if enron and other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading documents . enron has been filing documents in sacramento , california . ` ` they are still putting documents in their depository , and i don ' t think they ' ve completed that process , ' ' said alexandra montgomery , a consultant to the committee . it ` ` remains to be seen ' ' whether enron is complying with its subpoena , she said . the suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in california soared , leaving the state ' s two largest utilities insolvent . under california ' s plan to open its electricity market to competition , the utilities of pg & e corp . and edison international weren ' t allowed to pass rising costs to customers . ` ` i know that we ' re doing our best to comply with what the committee is asking for , ' ' enron spokesman mark palmer . ` ` we are putting documents in the depository , and we ' re looking forward to a speedy resolution . ' ' shares of houston - based enron have fallen by more than half since oct . 16 . the company ousted andrew fastow as the chief financial officer wednesday amid a u . s . securities and exchange commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost enron $ 35 million . grand jury enron also is one of the companies being investigated for civil and criminal violations by california attorney general bill lockyer , who convened a grand jury in june . lockyer has been criticized by enron officials for telling the wall street journal in may that he would like to put enron chairman kenneth lay in ` ` an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says ` hi my name is spike , honey . ' ' ' lockyer later apologized for the remark . the attorney general ' s investigation is proceeding , lockyer spokeswoman sandra michioku said . michioku said she didn ' t know when civil or criminal charges against enron or other power providers might be filed . ` ` our investigation is still being pursued , ' ' she said . ` ` we had to go to court to get enron to turn over documents , so that slowed things down a bit . ' ' enron ' s palmer said he didn ' t know the status of the attorney general ' s investigation . ` ` i think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman , ' ' palmer said . more lawsuits enron , along with other major power providers such as duke energy corp . and dynegy inc . , face at least five lawsuits alleging they manipulated california energy prices in violation of antitrust laws . the cases , which include separate complaints filed by the city of san francisco , california lieutenant governor cruz bustamante and various consumers , currently are in state courts awaiting a coordination proceeding , said michael aguirre , a lawyer representing bustamante . the lawsuits should be assigned to a judge by the end of next month , he said . if the complaints succeed , the companies might be ordered to repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines , including triple damages . enron ' s stock fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 , declining for the eighth day in a row . the shares have fallen 80 percent in the past 12 months . - - daniel taub in los angeles , ( 323 ) 801 - 1261 or enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 ) 2001 - 10 - 26 16 : 18 ( new york ) enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 ) ( adds investor comment in fourth paragraph . ) houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $ 3 billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low - interest , short - term loans . the company ' s stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by enron ' s former chief financial officer . the shares fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 today . chief executive officer kenneth lay has failed to reassure investors that the company ' s credit rating won ' t be cut , investors said . enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets , where short - term loans carry lower rates than banks offer . ` ` do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , ' ' said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth third bancorp . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of management . ' ' the company will use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding , enron spokesman mark palmer said . bonds drop enron ' s 6 3 / 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2009 , declined 1 1 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating of ` ` bbb + , ' ' yield 9 . 53 percent . investors have grown concerned that the company ' s credit rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions . enron ' s decision to tap its credit line was ` ` a smart financial move , ' ' said stephen moore , a vice president at moody ' s investors service who follows the company . ` ` it took away the hassle and time - consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital . ' ' though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for seven years . a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value of enron investors ' stock . partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to the partnerships to keep related debt off its books . the partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the assets . other liabilities if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell for and the amount of the debt . one way would be issuing common shares to exchange for enron preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would thin out the holdings of every other investor . of the two main bond - rating companies , moody ' s and fitch have enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . egan - jones rating co . today lowered its rating on enron ' s debt to ` ` bb + , ' ' one notch below investment grade , from ` ` bbb - . ' ' enron ' s liabilities associated with the partnerships amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion , the company has said . enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost the company $ 35 million in direct losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from the partnership , reducing shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . ` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the benefit of himself , ' ' fifth third ' s cassady said . jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , lay said in a statement . - - russell hubbard in the princeton newsroom at 609 - 750 - 4651 , or at keller rohrback l . l . p . investigates potential claims on behalf of enron corp . - - ene - - employees and former employees 10 / 26 / 2001 business wire ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire ) seattle - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 26 , 2001 - - seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . is currently investigating potential erisa claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of enron ' s retirement and 401 ( k ) plans . the investigation period covers january 2000 through october 2001 . the investigation focuses on concerns that , under the law interpreting erisa , enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a plan investment . rather than providing complete and accurate information to the plans ' participants , it may be alleged that enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information , thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the plans . this investigation is being conducted in light of recent events . on oct . 16 , 2001 , enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking "" non - recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax , or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share , "" in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships , controlled by enron ' s cfo , and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market , the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition , several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading , gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets . if you are a member of an enron retirement plan , wish to discuss this announcement , or have information relevant to the investigation , you may contact paralegal liza catabay , or any member of our team ( britt tinglum , liza catabay , or lynn sarko ) toll free at 800 / 776 - 6044 , or via e - mail at investor @ kellerrohrback . com . seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade . its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars . contact : keller rohrback l . l . p . liza catabay , 800 / 776 - 6044 investor @ kellerrohrback . com www . seattleclassaction . com 15 : 16 edt october 26 , 2001 copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .",0

I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issues
or my setup issues.First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting
some different than I should be.Thanks for all the effortJim

I've just changed my sendmail installation and am looking for the 'proper' way to pass it through there, systemwide, before accepting it and sending it to the users.  It's kinda problematic to set up procmail scripts for every user, when the user's home directories are NFS mounted....and the source is on my own machine, on which I try new things. (And it's the only machine with the drivespace...)

not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend

( 1 ) the meeting was called to order and chaired by chair richie kayne . the attendees were asked to introduce themselves . ( 2 ) the minutes of the feb . 21 , 1993 section meeting were distributed and approved . ( 3 ) the results of the last election were reported : sarah ( sally ) thomason was elected chair - elect for 1995 , and david caplan was elected member at large 1995 - 1998 . the members of the steering committee for 1995 ( as of february 21 , 1995 ) therefore consist of : retiring chair richie kayne , chair stephen anderson , chair elect sarah thomason , secretary victoria a . fromkin , members - at - large : david caplan , paul chapin , ilse lehiste . arnold zwicky remains as the council delegate through 1996 . the chair expressed the appreciation of all members of section z to retiring chair barbara lust ( who will serve on the council in 1995 ) and david pesetsky . ( 4 ) four sessions were sponsored by section z at this meeting : bilingualism : when is the best age to learn a second language ? ; endangered languages ; linguistic science and language technology : machines and human language ; structures of language : batons for cognitive science and neuroscience . in addition , section z cosponsored a session organized by the psychology section : instincts to learn . kenneth hale presented one of the topical lectures - - the scientific cost of the global loss of linguistic diversity . ken hale s lecture and the session on endangered languages received a great deal of interest from the press . ( this issue made national press coverage by the time of the section meeting , ) the section extended its gratitude to the session organizers and speakers , and to ken hale for their efforts in bringing linguistics to the general scientific community at the aaas . ( 5 ) dr . susan speece , chair of the department of biological sciences at anderson university , anderson in , who has been appointed as education liaison from the education section to section z was introduced . she distributed copies of life science standards and curriculum development for k-12 and reported on the work of the science education reform committee of the national research council and asked for suggestions and input from our section regarding science education k-12 and also undergraduate science education . , a discussion followed in which it was announced that stephen crain is heading a committee of the linguistic society of american on linguistics in the curriculum which is also concerned with the teaching of linguistic science in the schools . it was suggested that crain be asked to contact dr . speece . individuals were urged to view the poster paper linguistics in the schools : developing an epistemology of science by maya honda and wayne o neil on display from 10 : 30 to 3 : 30 on saturday , february 18 , in the marriott south exhibit hall . this poster paper is directly related to the subject under discussion . ( 6 ) budget . vicki fromkin reported on the budget situation . up to this meeting , section z received $ 2500 / annum from the aaas office which was supposed to cover the travel expenses of the section officers for the annual meeting , refreshments , and any expenses of the ssponsored sessions ( organizers and speakers ) that could be provided . last year we offered no support to symposia speakers . thus , this year after subtracting the probable expenses of the officers , the section budget total came to approximately $ 2500 . symposia organizers sent their requests to vicki fromkin . after she determined the cheapest possible fares of the speakers , she divided the sum so that no speaker who had requested funds would suffer financially more than the others and recommended to the aaas staff that these sums be disbursed . this leaves the section with a zero balance . at the planning committee which she attended , vicki reported that the staff had decided to change the section budgets . the expenses of the officers would no longer be deducted from the section allocation but would be borne by the central office . however , the sections would now receive much lower allocations ; section z will only receive $ 1000 / annum . it is urgent that symposia organizers inform their invited speakers that there is little if any money for expenses and speakers should attempt to find money elsewhere . ( 7 ) 1996 aaas annual meeting , baltimore , maryland , 8-13 february 1996 . proposals for sessions are due april 1 , 1995 . a general discussion was held regarding sessions to be sponsored by section z . the section agreed that it would like to see the following session organized . ( note that these are not necessarily the titles of the symposia to be submitted but rather signify the contents we would like to see presented . ) ( the name in parenthesis after each is the person designated to contact the proposed organizers ) i . language in the schools . proposed organizers wayne o neil , maya honda , walt wolfram ( wayne o neil ) ii . new technology ( e . g . mri , ct , pet ) in the study of the biology of language . proposed organizer : david caplan ( v . fromkin ) iii . the structure and acquisition of sign languages . proposed organizer : ursula bellugi ( v . fromkin ) iv . child language acquisition . proposed organizer : lila gleitman ( v . fromkin ) v : connectionism vs . symbolic systems models of cognition . proposed organizer : paul smolensky ( steve anderson ) ( following the meeting some of the members of the section steering committee proposed that geoffrey nunberg also be asked to submit a proposal on prescriptivism / the equality of dialects / english only legislation or such related issues . fromkin and anderson will contact him ) barbara lust informed the section that we also received a tentative idea for a possible symposium from lisa menn ( working with both lsa and asha ) which would be on theoretical , modeling and therapeutic studies of the acquisition of phonology . this was referred to sharon goldsmith of asha for further consideration for their support . ( 8 ) 1997 aaas annual meeting , seattle , washington . an opening discussion on possible sessions for the seattle meeting was held it was suggested that individuals should submit proposals to the nsf to fund sessions on reports of current research which would be of interest to the scientific community . such proposals should be submitted to paul chapin by no later than july 15 , 1995 in order to have a funding decision from nsf by december 1995 , in time to submit a session proposal to the aaas program committee . ( 9 ) membership . as of the time of the meeting , 169 members of aaas had selected section z as their primary affiliation , and according to mike spinella ( aaas staff , who attended the meeting briefly ) , 141 had designated section z as their secondary affiliation and 205 as their third . this total of 515 satisfies the aaas requirements for establishing section z as a permanent section of the aaas . in the words of mike spinella you re in ! . however , it is important that we continue to increase the members whose first affiliation is to our section . we would like to see that number grow to a minimum of 400 . in the discussion on methods to increase membership it was suggested that we ask the lsa if we can include a letter from the section chair and secretary in the regular mailings to linguistic department chairs asking if each department would subsidize the membership fee for one member ( probably the chair ) of the department . if the chair is already a member , another person should be designated , who could be elected by the faculty or determined in some other way . this would substantially increase our membership . sharon goldsmith from asha announced that she would be willing to place a notice in the asha newsletters and publications which go to 80 , 000 of their members . paul chapin agreed to draft a letter to send to asha for this purpose . it was also suggested that a membership form be included in the mailings . she also thanked section z for their support of the symposium on bilingualism which was organized by asha and introduced david kean , of the asha research and tehcnology committee . . barbara lust suggested that we contact all the international organizations such as lagb who supported the formation of the new section and ask them to publicize the section and urge their members to join . the question of the cost of joining aaas was discussed . there was confusion as to the cost of joining as a supporting member ( without receiving science ) particularly for foreign applicants . mike spinella assured us that supporting memberships cost $ 35 . 00 for us , and all non - us members . on the application form this $ 35 . fee is stated only for spouses of members , but we were assured that it is for anyone who joins as a supporting member . ( 10 ) endangered languages . michael strauss spoke on the importance of our establishing ties with non-linguists concerned with conservation and diversity , i . e . conservation biology , etc . david harmon of the george wright society of the world parks congress was introduced and told the group that until recently he did not realize the extent of the problem re maintaining linguistic diversity and the dangers facing endangered languages . he supported the suggestion that linguists concerned with this issue work together with other groups interested in cultural and biological diversity and endangered species . ( 11 ) at the 1994 meeting , it was agreed that it was important for linguists to submit research articles to science . this was reiterated . it was pointed out that one cannot complain about the contents of the journal and the heavy weighting toward biology if we do not submit articles . should they consistently be rejected we would then have grounds for complaint .

original copy of the MBR must be in /boot directory for it to work. 
Which is exactly what I didn't have.  The installation of Linux
Mandrake didn't afford me that luxury.Also, I'm glad you cleared up the fdisk issue.  I know better now --
previously I was under the impression that fdisk had a hidden switch. 
This is obviously not the case.--

1343,0.031,0.917,0.052,0.7705,"re : 5 . 1225 linguistics and imperialism with regard to hoberman 's comment , it would not make sense to say that linguistics is inherently imperialistic in nature , any more than it would for any other science , since linguistics is multi-faceted and has many purposes , some now well established and others continually evolving , e . g . , "" forensic "" applications of linguistics etc . since language is universal , applications for linguistics are universal . in my earlier comments i dwelt on diversity among languages because that 's where the connection between linguistics ( mainly as an aid to learning and teaching languages ) and multilingual empires ( = "" imperialism "" ) is easiest to see . however , i also noted that there are people who are interested in language and linguistic diversity for its own sake . i suspect that this is universal . although it may be reflected differently in different cultures . maybe the universality of interest in language and linguistic diversity is reflected in myths about the origin of such diversity , or other kinds of "" pre-linguistic "" explanations . among cultures which seem particularly ethnocentric to me , classic athenian culture perhaps was less encouraging to interest in other languages than most cultures ( with the us perhaps close behind but also with a complex fear and insecurity about languages other than english ) . nevertheless , we see from plato 's cratylus that differences between greek ( in its various diachronic forms ) and the "" barbarian "" languages was put to philosophical use . if you read cratylus , you ' ll see that plato , through socrates , was putting some value on philosophical arguments which brought in data from other languages . ( even though there 's a lot of sarcasm and tongue in cheek in the whole issue as plato treats it in cratylus , i . e . , whether the words of language are "" natural "" or "" conventional "" / are there "" correct "" words for ideas / concepts / things ? - - plato is always a polemicist , reacting to rival schools of thought . ) i would like to re-open the issue ( i think it was once opened before on the list ) about how different cultures "" explain "" language diversity , and whether there is a culture which prevents all individual members from being interested in language for its own sake . i do n't think that could logically be possible - - but what do i know ? in any case , this might give us some insights into the "" prehistory of linguistics "" , and also into the still present motivations of some linguists to attach themselves to this aspect of our culture . benji",0

Date: Not suppliedGreat article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using 
semi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting 
computers are sent to the developing world for activist use.     For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone 
    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the 
    nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they 
    cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a 
    day's wage for most of the population.     The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are 
    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an 
    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any 
    international shipping duties on the computers. ""It's what you call real 
    free trade,"" says Eddie Nix.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Markoffcharney!_)[1] http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/23/antiglobal_geeks/index.html

  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications
  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During
  and Between Online Meetings  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for
  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network  ###  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure
  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors
  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx
  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time
  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class
  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this
  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around
  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience
  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how
  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between
  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple
  copies of constantly changing documents.  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of
  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit
  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than
  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured
  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also
  essential.  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for
  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be
  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be
  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules
  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at
  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,
  inside or outside company firewalls.  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web
  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at
  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or
  ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across
  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents
  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx
  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,
  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.  ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed
  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says
  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination
  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist
  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by
  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.""  ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,
  training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president
  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the

products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as
a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -
there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,
but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created 
much more easily within the petrochemical industry.Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower
oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world 
war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from
waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as 
petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication 
of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously
being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately 
matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock
oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the
gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to 
cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.
Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals
(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely 
difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the
petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect
that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,
just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,
for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling
like pig farms and fish and chip shops...Robin Hill, STEAMY BESS, Brough, East Yorkshire********************************************************************

- - - - - - - - the prolamat conference is an internationally well known event for demonstrating and evaluating activities and progress in the field of discrete manufacturing . sponsored by the international federation for information processing ( ifip ) , the prolamat is traditionally held every three years and it includes the whole area of advanced software technology for design and manufacturing in discrete manufacturing . past conferences have explored : - manufacturing technology , - advances in cad / cam , - software for discrete manufacturing , - software for manufacturing . the eight international prolamat focused on the theme of man in cim . the 1995 prolamat featured the theme of life cycle modelling for innovative products and processes . the 1998 conference in italy will be organized by the university of trento , school of engineeering and department of computer and managemet sciences , jointly with istituto trentino di cultura , under the auspices of the wg2 for "" computer - aided design "" and wg3 for "" computer - aided manufacturing "" of the technical committee 5 for "" computer applications in technology "" . this conference will be the last prolamat before the next century , and it provides an opportunity to investigate and imagine what the digital communications revolution going on all around us will mean for manufacturing . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conference subjects -

case studies and descriptions of experience with emerging technologies for : - concurrent engineering involving shared product and process models , - applications of telecommunications for agility , innovation or virtual organizations , - distributed business process reengineering and out sourcing , - managing virtual teams and developing and sustaining virtual organizations , - advances in telecommunication technology for collaborative knowledge processing for engineering - tele-presence , remote sensing , and distributed coordination of processes , - collaborative feature modelling , feature-based design , and geometric modelling - integration of emerging technologies and tools into existing product development -

- - - - - - representations , reuse people , not machines , design new products and make manufacturing systems work . increasingly , groups of people are required to design new products and bring them to market . requirements for agility and the suitability of specific manufacturing processes must be matched with the culture and knowledge base of the work force . world - class processes have floundered when this was not done . information and communication systems can either amplify or reduce the magnitude of differences across culture or engineering discipline . researchers specializing in knowledge representation , modelling , communications , standardization , and reuse will be invited to share their experiences and research perspectives . - enterprise data sharing across engineering , cultural , and supply chain boundaries , - distributed manufacturing and supply chain management - early stage product development which dynamically incorporates supplier constraints - standard models for component information representation , product and process interchange , - technologies for knowledge sharing , collaboration , and across the product lifecycle , - adaptive systems for organizational management , knowledge sharing , education , and training - organizational and manufacturing process simulation - organizing and representing design and manufacturing process for dissemination and reuse - the interface between human and machine for information sharing , training , education , -

1367,0.045,0.863,0.092,0.9931,"re : 5 . 1462 comparative method a couple of remarks on recent exchange on comparative method : 1 ) as far as importance of morphology is concerned i believe that alexis is right ( sorry , karl ! ) . it is important , but i think that it would be impossible to insist that only morphological prallels like latin est , sunt and german ist , sind cited by karl teeter can prove relationship . old church slavic has the parallel forms iest # and so ~ t # , perfectly agreeing with karl teeter 's latin and german . however , in modern russian the present of copula dissapeared ( we can still recognize forms like iest ' and sut ' , but they sound bitterly archaic ) : on student ( he [ is ] student ) , oni studenty ( they [ are ] stu - dents ) . let us imagine the situation when the only surviving slavic language is russian and we just do not have old church slavonic materials . does the lack of the paradigm make russian less "" indoeuropean "" than latin or german , or does it make impossible the proof of its ie nature ? i think that the answer is in the negative . second , alexis is certainly right when he says that a refusal to admit lexical evidence will make impossible to prove that mandarin is related to cantonese or that vietnamese is related to khasi . even worse , we won't be able to state that beijing mandarin is related to xi ' an mandarin , or that hanoi vietnamese is related to saigon vietnamese , as nothing resembling est , sunt / ist , sind can be found in these closely related dialects . moreover , we would have to dismantle the families of north and north east asia as well , since their agglutinative morphology also does not exhibit anything of the kind ie does . therefore , continuing this claim logically to its end , we will have to state that there are around 50 unrelated languages in japan alone , because we have no possibility to prove the genetic relationship of various japanese dialects and subdialects , since they do not have a grammar like ie . there are cases when proof of genetic relationship is based mostly on grammar , but there are cases when it rests solely on lexical items , as well as there are lucky cases like ie when one can demonstrate the relatedness on the basis of both grammar and lexicon . absolutization of any of this cases may lead us to dismissal of pretty well established language families . the cases like "" proto _ english - french "" can actually be easily controlled by using basic voca - bulary in lexical comparisons : no matter how many romance words were borrowed b yenglish , its basic vocabulary is still germanic , which can be easily demon - strated , contrary to those who try to label the very idea of basic vocabulary as "" semantic primitive "" . 2 ) geoffrey pullum writes : ) i wonder if it would not be a good idea to hear something - - from the defenders of wide-ranging and large-time - depth comparison , prefererably - - concerning what would count as evidence against a genetic relationship ? the same things as in case of lower-level comparisons : either lack of regular phonetic correspondences , or lack of enough number of cognates , representing basic vocabulary items and / or basic morphological markers , established on the basis of these regular correspondences . this is why i , not being amerindianist myself , cannot believe in amerind : greenberg did not present any correspondences at all , and his whole method of "" mass comparisons "" is in direct violation of traditional and conservative comparative methodology . therefore , i would side with greenberg opponents on this matter . but i believe that it is absolutely unfair to put illich - svitych in one company with greenberg and ruhlen , as geoffrey pullum does in his posting . illich - svitych work starts with charts of phonetic correspondences , which do work regularly throughout his 3 - volume work , and is , therefore , in sharp contrast with greenberg 's "" mass comparisons "" . the whole work , at least in the areas i can judge of ( altaic and uralic ) is done with painstaiking care and accuracy , reflecting the state of the art , contemporary to the time when his work was done ( sixties ) . may be the opponents of long-range compa - rison should at last familiarize themselves with works of illich - svitych , dolgopol 's kii and others , which as i believe represent a successful long-range comparative work ( though it does not necessarily mean that i agree with all illich - svitych 's proposals : many things remain to be done ) , rather then to repeat the groundless allegations in illich - svitych address , and come forward with some concrete arguments against his work , rather than general statements that illich - svitych 's work is like greenberg 's or that there is a ceiling to the comparative method . sincerely , sasha vovin avvovin @ miamiu . acs . muohio . edu",0

Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple â€œ3â€ Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:â€œTo whom it may concern,I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70â€™s & 80â€™s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?Sincerely,RJâ€Location: Midwest, U.S.A.â€œThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.â€-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAâ€œIâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and I really know my stuff.  I donâ€™t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple â€œ3â€.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70â€™s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!â€  -- A.J.Location: United Kingdom

run (manually copied into /usr/lib/win32/), but personally, I've been very
happy with mplayer's default (which is ffmpeg's ffdivx decoder) for nearly
all the DivX files I used. The only ones that still require (from my own
experience) the use of the win32 codecs are the ones encoded with a strange
DivX 3 sound format... and I've really not seen any quality or speed
improvements when using them.Matthias> On Sat, Jun 08, 2002 at 11:39:03PM +0200, Axel Thimm wrote:

http://www.viking-z.org/r20i.htmM09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.
DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on
their hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in
Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked
together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid
derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.
The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities
with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a
description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see
them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but
not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth
even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a
renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.
The definitive work on dragons is ""The Flight of Dragons"" by Peter
Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long
bow. Targets do not come much bigger.Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that
there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard
their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They
survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.
They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet
(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves
but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the
dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also
to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote
viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are
contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be
encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and
mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help
so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great
difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove
all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of
Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus
if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of
all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their
psi.THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to
hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of
rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young
hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made
them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to
keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this
they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an
act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the
ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and
so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have
become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep
them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and
only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend
to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is
primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not
suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.
Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,
even if they are standing on ice.Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act
of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female
can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird
sitting on a nest.Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,
while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate
all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then
purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our
religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,
regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to
concentrate on ""How to Brainwash your Neighbour"". Conscious thought has
built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using
""How to care for and protect one's young"" as a foundation.Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something ""A load of
dinosaur's eggs"". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity
tends to purge all malice back to its roots.It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,
aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on

serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take
control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the
following.Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.
Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing
hormones, abilities, etc.
Mind machines.
The original engraving or engram.
GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T
hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the
first job holders.
TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of
time.My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.
The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic
Subconscious, etc.
EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.
Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever
one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the
higher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or
other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.
Every extinct race, etc.
BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via
genetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.
Every blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.

I may be wrong but I think a single select entry field is used
for selecting messages and switching folders. Restricting the entries
to be numeric would break the folder switching functionality, wouldn't
it?My version of MsgChange, not yet updated, has a check    if {$msgid != {}} {
	# Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line instead
	if {$msgid < 0}  return
    } else {
    ...at the start of the procedure which takes care of the single '-' case.
Perhaps the thing to do is for MsgChange to validate a msgid as a
number before continuing.KevinIn message <200208280108.VAA30178@blackcomb.panasas.com>, Brent Welch writes:

( see section 18 , title 1301 , 1302 & 1342 of the us postal and lottery code . ) it is a modified plan similar to that of companies such as tupperware and mary kay . best of all , it can earn advertisers like ourselves , thousands in a few months . what exactly is multi-level marketing ( mlm ) ? mlm requires that you send letters to fellow advertisers ( we will help you with the addresses ) asking that they buy your product with the understanding that once they do , they will be included as a member of your program . ( just as tupperware or avon requests salespeople to buy their products to "" show "" to their customers . ) the letter you send always has your name on it along with 2 - 8 advertisers . it is based on this premise : ( assuming a 3 member list and a 100 % response ) level # 1 - you send out 20 letters with your name in the # 1 position . 20 people reply . level # 2 - those 20 replies send out letters with your name in the # 2 position . 400 people reply level # 3 - those 400 replies send out letters with your name in the # 3 position . 8000 people reply . you receive a total of 8 , 420 replies and are unable to receive more , because once your name reaches the bottom of any list , it is eliminated and replaced by new members . if you asked for $ 10 for your product , you earn $ 84 , 000 . of course a 100 % response rate is unrealistic , instead expect between $ 35 , 000 and $ 60 , 000 . now , before you decide that this is the dumbest thing you have ever heard of and decide to throw this away , please look at the statistic : 91 % of all classified advertisers join one or more of these programs . why ? because they are sincere in wanting to make money ! otherwise , they would not have advertised in the beginning . knowing this fact , i know that you would like to read on . by now , you have received many letters of this type . this alone should prove that these programs are working . do me a favor , save this and all of the other letters . when you have the time , sit down and compare all the programs . your financial success depends on your making the best choice . if you are like most newcomers , your first instinct is to join the program that offers the most money or offers the cheapest price per product . before you do this , i ask that you think and answer the following questions about each program : 1 . how many participants are on the list ? the more names there are , the more responses you will need . an average 8 person list requires 1 , 500 , 000 responses before obtaining $ 100 , 000 for each participant . a 3 member list needs 3 , 500 responses . 2 . how much do i receive per product ? if you join a $ 2 . 00 plan , know beforehand that you will need 5 times the amount of replies as a $ 10 . 00 program . the $ 2 . 00 plan will also take 6 months longer for you to receive big money , obviously because you need more responses . 3 . do the words cheat-proof and monitored appear on the plan ? if the program is based on honesty and integrity alone , it will fail . face it , when it comes to money , very few people can be honest . cheat - proof means that there is a way to insure that every member gets paid . whereas monitored means that members are watching to make certain that the list never gets altered . this can be done ! also know that you are receiving many $ 2 . 00 plans , not because they are popular , but because the members must keep resending information to meet their goals . . . only 6 % of all advertisers join $ 2 . 00 programs . you probably have received only a few $ 5 and $ 10 programs . these plans work ! there is no need to send hundreds of letters and monitoring is effective . 4 . how much money do i want to earn , and how much is my initial investment ? if you want to earn $ 50 , 000 for example , know that you need 25 , 000 $ 2 . 00 responses . when you figure your investment , make sure it includes printing and stamps . if a plan will not accept checks , it is not legitimate . finally , narrow your choices and choose the best program to suit your needs . hopefully , you will see that , like 76 % of us , this one is the best choice . our program this is a cheat-proof 3 - level plan . we pay $ 10 for the product of each member on the list . you will only be required to send out 20 letters ( how to get names is supplied ) and your total investment is $ 40 ( including postage and printing ) . you only need 4 replies throughout the entire program and you ve lost nothing ! plus , we offer a bonus plan in which you can earn $ 20 , 000 more with no extra effort ! your earnings are based on the 3 - step plan outlined in the prior page . if we receive a 100 % response rate , we can all earn $ 84 , 000 ! of course , a 100 % participation again , is unrealistic . members are reporting $ 35 , 000 - $ 60 , 000 within 2 months ( without the bonus plan ) . how do i join ?

15 $ 1 . 05 binding and control in ccg and its relatives mark steedman the ccg account of the unbounded constructions - in particular , relativisation and coordination - generalizes the notion of surface structure in a way that disrupts traditional notions of dominance and command . this has led researchers in other frameworks to suggest that the theory is fundamentally incompatible with a coherent theory of binding and control - the bounded constructions . the present paper offers a theory of binding in ccg which preserves the original account of the unbounded dependencies , and which renders it immediately compatible with other theories , tag in particular . the theory requires the abandonment of one assumption that has been traditional ( though not essential ) in other categorial approaches . the significance of the move is discussed . ircs-94 - 16 $ 3 . 66 null subjects in early child english and the theory of economy of projection tom roeper bernhard rohrbacher in this paper , we present new evidence showing that some of the empty subjects produced by young children acquiring english cannot be subsumed under the performance limitation analysis of bloom ( 1990 ) or the topic - drop analysis of rizzi ( 1994 ) . we argue contra sano & hyams ( 1994 ) that these missing subjects are instances of pro , not pro , and demonstrate that the economy-based pro-drop theory of speas ( 1994 ) handles our data in an elegant fashion . the analysis we propose links the acquisition of subjects to the acquisition of functional morphology , in accordance with the minimalist program developed since chomsky ( 1989 ) . one desirable consequence of the approach taken here is that no recourse to a pro-drop parameter is necessary . ircs-94 -

18 $ . 87 active part - decomposition , shape and motion estimation of articulated objects : a physics - based approach ioannis a . kakadiaris dimitri metaxas ruzena bajcsy we present a novel , robust , integrated approach to segmentation shape and motion estimation of articulated objects . initially , we assume the object consists of a single part , and we fit a deformable model to the given data using our physics-based framework . as the object attains new postures , we decide based on certain criteria if and when to replace the initial model with two new models . these criteria are based on the model 's state and the given data . we then fit the models to the data using a novel algorithm for assigning forces from the data to the two models , which allows partial overlap between them and determination of joint location . this approach is applied iteratively until all the object 's moving parts are identified . furthermore , we define new global deformations and we demonstrate our technique in a series of experiments , where kalman filtering is employed to account for noise and occlusion . ircs-94 -

1472,0.025,0.859,0.116,0.9988,""" english plus "" resolution in congress the "" english - plus "" resolution below was introduced into the house of representative on july 13 by rep . jose serrano ( d - n . y . ) , along with 31 other democratic cosponsors and one republican , ileana ros - lehtinen ( fla . ) . it is a nonbinding statement of policy intended as counter to six english - only bills now pending in congress . ( these measures include the king bill , h . r . 1005 , which would declare english the official language , end bilingual education and bilingual ballots , and require all government business to be transacted in english ; and the only slightly less restrictive emerson bill , h . r . 123 , which likewise declares english the official language and ends all federal funding for bilingual education . the emerson bill has more than 120 sponsors and is held to be likely to pass this year ; hearings will probably be scheduled once the present conflicts over the budget are resolved . ) some opponents of english - only measures have felt that the wording of this resolution is not as strong as they would like , particularly as it makes only indirect reference to bilingual education programs . still , its passage would have an important symbolic effect , and even if it should be defeated in committee , it will at least help to draw the battle lines over this issue . the lsa executive committee voted at its meeting this may to give its support to this resolution ; and in a mail ballot a few years ago the membership of the society declared its opposition to english - only measures by a margin of 94 to 6 percent . individual linguists may want to make their views on the english - plus resolution known to members of the house committee on economic and educational opportunities , whose names follow the text of the resolution below . committee members can be reached at : the honorable _ _ _ _ _ _ _ u . s . house of representatives washington , dc 20515 geoff nunberg concurrent resolution entitled , the ` ` english plus resolution ' ' . whereas english is the primary language of the united states , and all members of the society recognize the importance of english to national life and individual accomplishment ; whereas many residents of the united states speak native languages other than english , including many languages indigenous to this country , and these linguistic resources should be conserved and developed ; whereas this nation was founded on a commitment to democratic principles , and not on racial , ethnic , or religious homogeneity , and has drawn strength from a diversity of languages and cultures and from a respect for individual liberties ; whereas multilingualism , or the ability to speak languages in addition to english , is a tremendous resource to the united states because such ability enhances american competitiveness in global markets by permitting improved communication and cross-cultural understanding between producers and suppliers , vendors and clients , retailers and consumers ; whereas multilingualism improves united states diplomatic efforts by fostering enhanced communication and greater understanding between nations ; whereas multilingualism has historically been an essential element of national security , including the use of native american languages in the development of coded communications during world war ii , the korean war , and the vietnam war ; whereas multilingualism promotes greater cross-cultural understanding between different racial and ethnic groups in the united states ; whereas there is no threat to the status of english in the united states , a language that is spoken by 94 percent of united states residents , according to the 1990 united states census , and there is no need to designate any official united states language or to adopt similar restrictionist legislation ; whereas ` ` english - only ' ' measures , or proposals to designate english as the sole official language of the united states , would violate traditions of cultural pluralism , divide communities along ethnic lines , jeopardize the provision of law enforcement , public health , education , and other vital services to those whose english is limited , impair government efficiency , and undercut the national interest by hindering language skills needed to enhance international competitiveness and conduct diplomacy ; and whereas such ` ` english - only ' ' measures would represent an unwarranted federal regulation of self-expression , abrogate constitutional rights to freedom of expression and equal protection of the laws , violate international human rights treaties to which the united states is a signatory , and contradict the spirit of the 1923 supreme court case meyer v . nebraska , wherein the court declared that ` ` the protection of the constitution extends to all ; to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with english on the tongue ' ' ; now , therefore , be it resolved by the house of representatives ( the senate concurring ) , that the united states government should pursue policies that - - ( 1 ) encourage all residents of this country to become fully proficient in english by expanding educational opportunities ; ( 2 ) conserve and develop the nation 's linguistic resources by encouraging all residents of this country to learn or maintain skills in a language other than english ; ( 3 ) assist native americans , native alaskans , native hawaiians , and other peoples indigenous to the united states , in their efforts to prevent the extinction of their languages and cultures ; ( 4 ) continue to provide services in languages other than english as needed to facilitate access to essential functions of government , promote public health and safety , ensure due process , promote equal educational opportunity , and protect fundamental rights ; and ( 5 ) recognize the importance of multilingualism to vital american interests and individual rights , and oppose ` ` english - only ' ' measures and similar language restrictionist measures . house committee on economic and educational opportunities republicans democrats william f . goodling ( pa ) , chmn . william "" bill "" clay ( mo ) thomas e . petri ( wi ) george e . miller ( ca ) marge s . roukema ( nj ) dale e . kildee ( mi ) steven gunderson ( wi ) pat williams ( mt ) harris w . fawell ( il ) matthew g . martinez ( ca ) cass ballenger ( nc ) major r . owens ( ny ) bill barrett ( ne ) thomas g . sawyer ( oh ) randy cunningham ( ca ) donald m . payne ( nj ) peter hoekstra ( mi ) patsy t . mink ( hi ) howard mckeon ( ca ) robert e . andrews ( nj ) michael castle ( de ) john f .

the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.

Date: 2002-10-06T21:28:33-06:00Ted Rall: My Government Went to Afghanistan and All I Got Was This Stupid 
Pipeline[1] Summary: The US begun planning courting the Taliban for permission to build an 
oil pipeline since 1997. We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince 
him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and 
begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned 
to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 
9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline 
Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work 
for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline 
rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable 
because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't 
carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, 
carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have 
gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone 
after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect 
opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize 
Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. ""Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or 
right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for 
justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their 
friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of 
influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took 
advantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central 
Asia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will 
cause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.""[1] http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/pipeline0.html

ASK THE FOOLQ. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. 
I ALREADY HAVE 
A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW 
CAN I STOP IT? A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and 
they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to 
be removed from junk mail (er, ""direct mail"") lists and 
telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request. Full Answer:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562069-----------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR MONEY RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
No pressure. Right? Wrong. 
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
you can get behind. Let's get started! 1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with 
one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. 
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=5620723. INVEST FOR LESS 
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates 
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=5620734. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more 
to your retirement accounts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=5620745. REFINANCE AND SAVE 
When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity 
to save big money.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562075If this list seems too daunting, and you don't want to go it 
alone, you can get some unbiased, professional advice about your 
finances with TMF Money Advisor. In fact, we're so excited about

Independence, visit our Personal Finance area. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562077-----------------------------------------------------------------
SPOTLIGHTSHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
savings, keep it out of the market.Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure 
out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our 
nifty Savings Center.

COMMUNITY TIPSDO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
2002 to save money. -I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
 so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
 stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
 coupons at home. -Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
 have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
 like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
 $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. -I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
 get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
 a great time to do this. -Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
 a cheaper long-distance plan.-Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
 clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. -Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
 house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************Step 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these
Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be
ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and
you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.Step 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and
address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that
slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's
slot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.
Check the address again.Step 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot.Step 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and
replace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2's slot.Step 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and
replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot.Step 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and
replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This
step is how your own name and address is entered into the
list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,
your own name will go down the list of names until you have
reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The
key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from
you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.Step 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out
this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to
as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000
emails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings
you make, potentially the greater the number of people who
will order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then
make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email
showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.This is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of
this email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps
shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as
many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help
those who purchase the Guides from you to send out
emails of their own.Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate
reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list
with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.
That might seem to you like a clever move because new
buyers will be sending their money to these people.  But
that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.
What will benefit you most is having people who will send
out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new
buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to
be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by
effectively closing down the program with your name on
top of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There
wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver
will gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done
the work, and your name has worked its way to further
down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and
earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for
anyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don't
do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to
the five people on the list that one of the people will just
take your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest
assured.  As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you
as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find
new buyers.  So don't think the people on the list will try to
cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00.  The people on the list
would rather have you working hard because your effort will
benefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send
you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal
by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don't cheat.
Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.
******END OF SUMMARY************************=======REST OF MESSAGE======================With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in
this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary
people who may not have done any internet marketing before.
And the earnings potential is staggering!READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a
RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can
afford to buy that new car or home that you have been
looking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never
responded to one of these before either. One day though,
something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie
for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple
meat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?""  No matter where
you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day
that feeling came over me.I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing
had I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,
YouÂ’ll learn how to become a more effective communicator.
What can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and
confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover
your investment and make some good money: making over
half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct
marketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing
via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done
in the future, then the experience you will gain here could
be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing
a new career for you.= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =If you want to make serious money, read this message until
you understand it completely and feel confident to follow
through on what it advises.FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,
it will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You
are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such
and you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period
of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and
the others on the list of five.===========================================
*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY
===========================================Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that
you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%
(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better
but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only
5,000 each.Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only
5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also
send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of
those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.
That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders
for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each
for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response
is 625 orders for Guide # 4.Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total
of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125
orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This
may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a
very low response rate with a small number of emails being
sent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate
up just slightly.If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:
$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
emails each or more?  From the example above, you can see
the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the
amount of money from a small increase in the response rate.There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands more coming online every day.METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
===========================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on
the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start
with  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.
For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the
Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise
you how to get the large number of email addresses that
you need to send the new email containing your name and
address.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,
you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to
their email addresses.  This will benefit you because your
name would be further down the list, and their new buyers
will buy from you.  This is no different than ""customer
service"" in the retail or the  ""bricks and mortars"" business.===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow  ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks
or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it
is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope
and steal it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each
Guide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden
by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of
those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME
of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the
envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to
mail the envelope.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW
FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL
________________________________________________
YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,
you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If
not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,
YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and
cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice
and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can
KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people
are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE
MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!

What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
its considerably
clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
common practice of
putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV 
cameras, visiting dignitaries,
etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police 
with riot gear and pepper spray.We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
strayed from the permit area,
which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance 
ministers held here (the motorcade drove
by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and

Date: Not suppliedI've been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0 
Setup program. For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, 
Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so 
I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer 
than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup 
process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the 
wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already 
made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to 
change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and 
everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the 
Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted 
are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result 
is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll 
write more about what I learned.   One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to 
have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper 
right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently 
infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.  [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/fbsetup.jpg (FogBUGZ 3.0 Setup)]

periodically create hard links to every file on the hard drive that does not
have hard links.That way, when someone accidentally does ""rm *"" or whatever, you still have
a link under "".unwanted""Another script can then periodically clear out enough old files to ensure
that there is usually enough disk space.Although this sounds like a horrible hack. It would no doubt be much better
to have a transaction oriented file system with a rollback facility.  :)- Matthew

Dear Friend,This last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in 
Minnesota. Â The water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the 
breeze rustled their limbs. Â We had such a great time renewing old 
friendships, seeing how everyone's children had grown, and catching up on 
everyone's lives. Â The last day we had a family picture taken, thinking 
that we'd all send them out as our Christmas cards.In October we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. 
Everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but I could not 
find myself in the picture. Â I looked and looked and finally got out a 
magnifying glass. Â To my horror, I found this dark curly headed woman 
with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! Â Dear God it was me!!! 
Â My body resembled an inflated hot air balloon that would take off should 
a heavy wind arise... it was HIDEOUS! Â I had mirrors in my house but most of them were 
designed to only reflect Â from the waist up and I honestly hadn't noticed 
that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a 
shapeless clump of flesh. Â I was always so happy that I didn't have a lot 
of wrinkles, Â but I didn't realize that I wasn't wrinkled because my skin 
was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.Well, this situation was NOT  acceptable. Â But I was at a loss as to what to do. 
Â My willpower, well, basically sucks and I had so-o-o much weight to lose 
that I wasn't sure I'd live long enough to get it all off. Â Plus, I hate 
diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before I fall 
off the food wagon. Â My goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless.AND THEN 
IT HAPPENED. Â I received a brochure about a product called 
BERRY TRIM 
PLUS. Â It seemed to contain everything I needed. Â 
It curbs your appetite, increases energy, burns fat at the fastest rate 
possible, no special diets are required, you don't have to exercise like a 
lunatic, it doesn't make you feel speeded, Â AND IT 'S ALL NATURAL WITH NO 
ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS. Â It also was priced well below other products so 
I figured that if it didn't work I wouldn't be out much money. Â It is 
guaranteed, but I'm always too lazy to bother to send back the empty bottles 
so this diet supplement seemed perfect for me.It's been about 6 weeks now but I swear I'm beginning to look like that 
famous Cindy person that models. Â My cheekbones are absolutely glorious.. 
I swear I look like a new person and a good one at that. Â BERRY TRIM 
PLUS  also keeps your skin tight so you don't look like a 
Shar Pei with nasty folds of skin hanging all around after you lose the weight.
I promise you that this product works. Â It does everything it promises 
and then some. Â Just losing the weight alone, makes you feel so much 
better and younger. Â It puts zest back into your life and assures you 
that you'll achieve your weight loss goals. Â In another few weeks I will 
reach my goal...something I had given up on. Â Also, HLNA  offers an affiliate 
program so you might as well make a few bucks while losing those pounds.
Please keep the faith and order this product NOW  by clicking below.CLICK

(plus some anti-French abuse from the usual suspect).Well my brain doesn't hurt so much any more, and it was well worth it.
I've now got an even faster method for elliptic-curve point counting,
both pratically and asymptotically.It lifts a curve over a field of degree n in time O(n^(2+1/2+eps)),
or O(n^(2+eps)) with precomputation.  Before the best methods took
O(n^(3+eps)) without precomputation, or O(n^(2+1/2+eps)) with it.
The precomputation is done once per field, not per curve, and takes
time O(n^(3+eps)).  Here eps is an arbitrarily small number, hiding
some logarithmic factors.After lifting, you compute a norm in time O(n^(2+1/3+eps)) to get the
number of points on the curve.Here's an example over a 1009-bit field, without precomputation, using
a 1 GHz Pentium III:------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason. Here is a recent article from U.S. News that I actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository.-James Rogers jamesr@best.com -------------------------------------------- http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020916/misc/16meltdown.htmDefrosting the pastAncient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty of a warming worldBY ALEX MARKELSAs he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000 feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't live this high up.' ""Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bisonâ€“one that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's probably a lot more like it yet to be found.""And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru to Alaskaâ€“a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industryâ€“have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother Natureâ€“and lootersâ€“take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don't even realize they're ancient.That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"" recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human from the period ever found in North America.Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband, Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a wildlife biologist with the Yukon government.Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a 4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the ice patchâ€“and scores of others around the regionâ€“revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800 years of changing hunting practices.Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies. Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing darts.""Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell and St. Elias mountain rangesâ€“the United States' most glaciated terrainâ€“and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're probably about the only ones happy about it.""",0

"" throughout the discussions for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 , and this may help guide us to new models . vasant benjamin parsons 06 / 19 / 2000 04 : 11 am to : ect london credit trading cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , amitava dhar / corp / enron @ enron , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , grant masson / hou / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra j patel / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect subject : pricing credit on thousands of names all - our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] . most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information , making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective . currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under development : fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology . fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding differences . bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs , but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches . under testing . bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer , the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve , then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing . market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap prices . kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next . each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia , capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing system . our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights . the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc . the key steps to implementing such a system will be : establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to , which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping from rating / score to price . getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the model . building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and software packages to use ? determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the model . getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present such a price exists for very few credits . allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would take 6 - 10 man - months to develop . further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' . regards ben",0

Stick it on apt.freshmeat.net (the center of the apt universe, IMHO) and every time a new repository is added, the RPM can be rebuilt.  Heck, if I could get out of my depression, I could make the whole submission process automated....even making the RPM...

working perfectly on my Cyrix 333 box!).Now, I desperately need some games, especially TuxKart and FlightGear, but I 
forever get stuck on a dependency: everything needs OpenGL. Querying the rpm 
database for OpenGL gets me nowhere fast. Can anyone point me in the right 
direction? What, in RedHat, provides OpenGL?Sorry for the question, but I've just switched from SuSE and I'm used to being

Well it looks pretty much 99% sure that we will be moving in on Nov 1 to
the new house. I think the only thing that stops us now are acts of
dieties and total economic collapse..so no one mention the dow for the
next few weeks..In preperation we drove to Best Buy tonight and picked up the test core
for the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless
ap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptopI made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the
card, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether
hub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the
webinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some
more (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)
but all in all a smooth move.
Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of
funky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,
essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get
goofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between
the AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting
11mbs and at least 60% goodness.
Some cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works
inthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a
microwave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear
cat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad
thing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I
hope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )Ok, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bed
by vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow is
heading this way....DUCKKKKK

"" the resolution seems to send an additional signal that the senate does not see any great need to bail out edison . the assembly did not pass the resolution , however . given the senate ' s view , and the open hositility between davis and burton , davis ' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the senate with vetoes unless the senate first passes the davis ' edison bill . it is unclear at this time whether davis would play it that tough . with the legislature gone , the action turns to the puc , where a vote on da suspension is scheduled for thursday . we are working with customers and providers to stop da from being suspended , or at a minimum , to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive . finally , burton held a news conference this morning at which he said : burton and senator bowen ( bowen ' s been taking the lead on da in the senate ) will ask the california puc to do a study on how da can be retained without "" adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses . "" he doesn ' t know why "" the governor would waste taxpayers ' money to hold a special session .

1596,0.039,0.844,0.117,0.999,"thestreet . com : trade winds blowing enron further south trade winds blowing enron further south by peter eavis senior columnist 08 / 30 / 2001 02 : 45 pm edt url : enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) appears to be relying on asset sales to offset weakness in its high - profile energy trading operation . a billion - dollar sale of power plants likely made a hefty contribution to the energy giant ' s second - quarter profits , which are supposed to owe their rapid growth to the company ' s well - publicized trading acumen . a smaller sale of impaired assets to an affiliate company also may have helped nudge second - quarter numbers past wall street earnings estimates . one energy market source alleges the price tag on this deal was inflated . complicating matters , enron ' s financials make it difficult to determine exactly how much these deals may have contributed to earnings . for its part , enron flatly denies that it used one - time gains to meet estimates or that the price of the impaired - assets sale was inflated . but dependence on asset sales would mark a big step backwards for houston - based enron , which has long told investors that trading is its future . by shrewdly capturing a dominant position in the nation ' s fast - growing energy market , enron has expanded trading profits exponentially over the last couple of years . operating earnings from trading surged 160 % in 2000 to $ 1 . 6 billion , causing the stock to double . now there ' s chatter that enron ' s swashbuckling traders were caught out by the second quarter ' s unexpected drop in the prices of power and other energy commodities . in addition , the company booked a large loss in its broadband unit . if asset sales can ' t be repeated and trading income weakens , earnings could crater , observers say , which could pull enron ' s already battered stock down even lower . in fact , fear that enron ' s prodigious profits growth won ' t be sustained is the chief reason its stock price has dropped by half this year . other factors have contributed as well : investor dissatisfaction over enron ' s opaque and confusing financial statements have risen throughout the year , and earlier this month ceo jeff skilling quit after only six months on the job . skilling ' s departure sparked all sorts of dark theories about the real reason for his sudden move . enron chairman ken lay , who has now reassumed the ceo post , said this week that he aims to improve enron ' s disclosure . he has moved to allay concerns over top - level instability by promoting two experienced enron executives to the positions of president , also vacated by skilling , and vice chairman . but skeptics remain unconvinced . "" i think the second - quarter performance was bad in the trading operations and was covered up by asset sales , "" says mark roberts , director of research at off wall street , a cambridge , mass . - based stock analysis firm that doesn ' t do underwriting . ( off wall street issued a critical report on enron in may . ) for the quarter , enron made 45 cents a share , 3 cents more than analysts had expected . details , details one transaction investors want details on is the sale by enron north america of three gas - fired power plants to allegheny energy supply , a unit of allegheny energy ( aye : nyse - news - commentary ) , hagerstown , md . the deal took place in may for a price of $ 1 . 05 billion , according to allegheny ' s recent securities and exchange commission disclosures . ( allegheny declined to comment on the deal . ) enron ' s second - quarter earnings got a huge boost from the sale of these three so - called peaker plants , says roberts . he believes the gain on the sale may have been as high as $ 500 million . an energy company analyst at a wall street brokerage thinks it may have been closer to $ 300 million . ( his firm hasn ' t done recent underwriting for enron . ) enron ' s financial statements don ' t specify the size of the gain from the peakers , so called because they supply power when demand is strong . the company declines to offer a number , saying the gain figure is hard to isolate because it must be netted against gains or losses on contracts associated with the assets sold . however , enron ' s public disclosure states that proceeds from the sale are included in its commodity sales - and - services line , which is by far the biggest contributor to enron ' s earnings , producing $ 762 million in operating profits in the second quarter . the problem is that the firm ' s trading profits also are booked in this segment . as a result , investors can ' t know how much of the quarter ' s blowout commodity sales - and - services earnings came from the peaker sale and how much from straight trading . if roberts ' $ 500 million estimate is correct , trading may have accounted for only $ 262 million in second - quarter operating profit . partners indeed the other deal that ' s raising eyebrows is the sale in june by enron of texas - based assets that are used to produce mtbe ( methyl tertiary - butyl ether ) , the chemical compound added to gasoline to make it burn more efficiently . the assets were sold for $ 120 million by one subsidiary of enron to another subsidiary , called eott energy partners ( eot : nyse - news - commentary ) , chiefly a marketer and transporter of crude oil . any gain on the sale would have been booked in enron ' s wholesale line . the issues with the deal are plenty . it took place on june 30 , right at the end of the second quarter . this could be construed as a sign that enron pressed eott to do the deal then so it could include any gain in second - quarter results . then there ' s the question of price . enron took a $ 440 million impairment charge against these mtbe assets at the end of 1999 , responding to what it described at the time as "" significant changes in state and federal rules regarding the use of mtbe . "" some environmental authorities believe mtbe to be a dangerous substance and claim the mtbe content in drinking water has reached unacceptably high levels . skeptics ask : how can enron turn around 18 months after a massive impairment charge and sell the assets for $ 120 million ? in addition , an executive at another energy company that talked to enron about buying the mtbe assets claims they ' re worth $ 50 million at most ; he claims enron has long been trying to sell them for around $ 150 million . put bluntly , did enron stuff eott with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations ? an enron spokeswoman responds : "" eott views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business . it makes good business sense . "" and a recent eott sec disclosure states that eott ' s audit committee , made up of three directors who aren ' t employees or officers of any enron affiliate , as well as an investment bank , judged the sale price to be fair . however , the chairman of the audit committee , daniel whitty , is a director for two other enron subsidiaries . he declined to comment on the deal . a person familiar with enron ' s business adds that it was eott that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third - quarter numbers . this person also says the gain was "" immaterial "" to enron ' s second - quarter numbers , since there wasn ' t a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold . most important , this person insists , the $ 120 million price isn ' t based only on the assets sold . eott is also paying for a contract with enron that gives eott 10 years ' worth of mtbe - related business . what ' s more , enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in mtbe production , this person states . whatever the case with the mtbe assets , enron would go a long way toward fulfilling lay ' s promises of glasnost by breaking out asset - sale gains . "" they need to put their disclosure where their mouth is , "" concludes off wall street ' s roberts . know any companies that the market may be misvaluing ? detox would like to hear about them . please send all feedback to peavis @ thestreet . com . in keeping with tsc ' s editorial policy , peter eavis doesn ' t own or short individual stocks . he also doesn ' t invest in hedge funds or other private investment partnerships .",0

"" he said hpl has been showing losses of $ 50 million a year or more in recent years , "" but those numbers are meaningless "" because enron has been using it at discounted transportation rates to underpin its marketing efforts . olson said the sale is a continuation of enron ' s move to sell most of its hard assets and become a soft asset player . "" they are emphasizing their trading . they are doing far better at trading . "" for one houston - based risk manager , the sale of hpl by enron was a question of rate of return . the competition among intrastates in texas is fiercely competitive and for gas delivered to the houston ship channel it can be a game of half - cents , with a shipper on one of the multiple intrastates undercutting another to try to shave a profit , he said . enron recognized this and wanted out , he speculated . - -",0

It is actually a lot worse than this.  What it boils down to is that
only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 
What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively
still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top
executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
this may hold true for other European countries as well.  After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a
thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.-James Rogers

In my experience, this protest behavior is really only an issue in
""ultra-liberal"" coastal cities, which is where I normally live.  It is
part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more
serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain
West.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable
protest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if
heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the
local population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests
I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually
facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are
protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets
results.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses
and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known
to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very
effective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their
protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.

In fact, you can go get the sources for, say, GNU's /bin/true,
compile it yourself and try selling the resulting binary
for EUR 1000.  (And, with a good enough sales pitch, you
just might get away with it!)However, what the GPL does stipulate is that you must 
provide the sources for that binary if asked.  So I might
buy it from you for EUR 1000, compile it myself and sell
that binary for EUR 1.  Of course, I'll need to provide
the sources to anyone that asks as well.  But, I just
might make money at this, since there might be a market of
10000 people who would pay 1 euro for the convenience of
getting a binary.But then, John Looney would step in, buy it from me for
1 euro, burn it and the sources and some of his favourite
/bin/true patches on a CD and duplicate it for the cost of
the media or a cream bun, depending on how hungry he is.You see, the GPL doesn't force the binaries to be zero-cost
(or cost-of-media), but it puts a really big hole in any
business plan that solely resells GPL software.  You _can_
charge for it if you want, but you bloody well better be
providing some value for that money, or you'll go out of
business faster than a dot-com in 2001.And there are real ways to provide this value for money
(convenience of getting it on one CD, convenience of a
friendly installer, convenience of vendor-supplied updates,
convenience of having what lots of other people have,
posting a CD and paying a few euro is cheaper than downloading
over a modem, warm fuzzy feeling of getting something from
a ""real"" company, etc).There will be segments of the market that will pay various
amounts for GPL software and there will be others that don't.
Thankfully, the GPL allows for both, _by_design_.  But the
source will always be free (or minimal cost).Later,
Kenn

1662,0.047,0.858,0.095,0.9868,"re : risk metrics i completely agree with you . nevertheless , i am sorry if i did not make myself clear when we talked about this last tuesday : i am not advocating penalizing business units because of their lweek rovars or sharpes . i would certainly not set traders ' bonuses based on these numbers ( nor do i think anyone at enron would consider doing that ) . enron focuses on long term profit and risk . however , the long term is made up of many short terms , and catastrophes can occur if a company ' s management does not pay close attention to the latter . indeed , enron management is very interested in short term profitability ( they want to be notified of very large 1 and 5 day losses ) and short term risk ( we report daily var limit violations ) . in this spirit , i am simply offering 1 and 4 week rovars and sharpes as something interesting and useful that we can now produce from the dpr database , and i will let upper management use or ignore them as they see fit . regards , eugenio naveen andrews @ enron 09 / 08 / 2000 11 : 13 am to : eugenio perez / hou / ect @ ect cc : ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect subject : risk metrics eugenio , in regard to your recent e - mail concerning rovar , sharpe and other risk metrics , and our meeting on tuesday , it is imperative to understand that ( 1 ) while p & l is a number one can aggregate on a daily basis , var numbers on 1 - week or 4 - week basis , and consequently rovar numbers , are not meaningful operationally ( ie , trading activity and senior management decision - making ) and statistically . rovar and sharpe were designed to measure business unit performance over extended time periods ( preferably a year ) . specifically , you cannot penalize , or make reasonable business decisions about a unit , because of their 1 - week rovar or sharpe . ( 2 ) significant trading activity at ene is composed of long - term strategic trades ( seasonal plays with durations of over 6 months , perhaps ) , wherein desk heads and senior management have an intuitive feeling for their rovar ( over 6 months ) . a 1 - week or 4 - week "" interim "" number in this case is not useful . traders might purposefully want to make a certain 1 - week or 4 - week rovar low in their trading activity if they believe their 6 - month number can be high . in such a case , a 1 - week number might send dangerous messages to senior management . ( 3 ) conceptually , p & l and var , in isolation , are numbers which are sound and rigourously calculated . the ratio , however , one has to be careful about . the numerator ( cumulative p & l over a certain period ) can be aggregated by simple arithmetic summation , no problems . however , the denominator ( average daily var over a certain period ) relies on the underlying assumption that each point in your time series is independent and correlationless . to get a sufficient statistic for the denominator , one would have to take a large sample in your series ( 6 months or more ) , for a daily average var number to be meaningful , statistically . ( 4 ) the rac group has instituted similar metrics which have been in usage for over two years . the numbers are shown to the b . o . d with the express intent of comaring business unit performance on a 6 - month or yearly tenor . please contact matthew adams ( rac ) or myself to make sure that we are on the same footing regarding the actual calculation of such metrics . also , in the future , just to be consistent and on - the - same - page , please contact me or mr . adams if any risk - related numbers are to be showcased in a public forum . ( 5 ) finally , as you can probably corroborate , senior management might not be fully versed on the nuances of var , let alone 1 - week var ratios . therefore , one has to be wary of the misuse of ratios and risk metrics . i liked your presentation of your database on tuesday . i think it is a nice step in aggregating and dissecting p & l from disparate sources . best regards naveen",0

1) There are very few new ideas.
2) Problems exists until someone gets annoyed enough to actually fix them

around $500k* wealth to throw that amount,
which pretty much limits the non-working
class to a small, single-digit percentage
of households.  (how much overlap do we
have with the retirement cohort here?)The 2000 numbers pretty much confirm it:shows that the top 5% of incomes are mostly
two+-earner households, and the zero-earner 
households are rare above median incomes.
We are the workers' paradise.The census figured $18k as the cutoff for
lowest 5th, so with that as a poverty line,

how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? this workshop is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) , at which an international panel of invited experts will consider these questions in an attempt to identify the most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information . the follow-on acl workshop is intended to open the discussion to the computational inguistics community as a whole . the workshop will include ample time for discussion . a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the acl workshop . topics - - - - - the workshop will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automated ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedia communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics - based ) of pre-parsing , parsing , generation , information acquisition , etc . we invite submissions which report on work in these areas . all papers should clearly identify how the work addresses the issues and questions outlined above . submissions - - - - - - - - - - only hard-copy submissions will be accepted . authors should submit six ( 6 ) copies of the full-length paper ( 3500-5000 words ) . submissions should be sent to : nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa style files and templates for preparing submissions can be found at http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / styles . html the official language of the conference is english . important deadlines - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - submission deadline : march 23 , 1998 notification date : may 15 , 1998 camera ready copy due : june 15 , 1998 scientific committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - charles fillmore university of california berkeley , usa robert frederking carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid ( tentative ) university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy information sciences institute , usa nancy ide vassar college , usa lauri karttunen ( tentative ) rank xerox research , france kimmo koskenniemi ( tentative ) university of helsinki , finland mun kew leong national university of singapore joseph mariani limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury the mitre corporation , usa sergei nirenburg ( tentative ) new mexico state university , usa akitoshi okumura ( tentative ) nec , japan martha palmer university of pennsylvania , usa james pustejovsky brandeis university , usa peter schaueble eth , switzerland oliviero stock irst , italy felisa verdejo uned , spain piek vossen university of amsterdam , netherlands wolfgang wahlster dfki , germany organizers - - - - - - - - - robert frederking , carnegie mellon university , usa eduard hovy , isi , university of southern california , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa information - - - - - - - - - - information on the workshop can be found at http : / / www . cs . vassar . edu / ~ ide / translingual . html inquiries may be addressed to the organizers : robert frederking < ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu > eduard hovy < hovy @ isi . edu > nancy ide < ide @ cs . vassar . edu >",0

ALB> arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.ALB> ""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
ALB> impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
ALB> down, OK, we'll talk.""'ALB> But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
ALB> and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
ALB> for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
ALB> stress disorder.ALB> WHY?ALB> Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
ALB> say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
ALB> form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
ALB> impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.ALB> But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
ALB> no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
ALB> everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
ALB> need Wan,"" he said.ALB> ""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
ALB> secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
ALB> with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
ALB> their future husband.""ALB> Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
ALB> choose to use his agency.ALB> His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
ALB> over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
ALB> singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
ALB> not ""God's gift to women.""ALB> Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
ALB> own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.ALB> ""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
ALB> or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
ALB> Impossible,"" she said.ALB> ""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
ALB> good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ALB> ladies from other countries.""ALB> Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
ALB> the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
ALB> not a major obstacle.ALB> ""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
ALB> a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
ALB> couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
ALB> dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
ALB> very quickly.""ALB> Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
ALB> to the West.ALB> ""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
ALB> how to eat, and when to make tea.""ALB> PITFALLSALB> But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
ALB> Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
ALB> back in Bangkok, sad and angry.ALB> ""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
ALB> happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
ALB> spoke to me.""ALB> Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
ALB> there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""ALB> Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
ALB> unsuitable candidates are weeded out.ALB> ""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
ALB> comers.""ALB> Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
ALB> arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
ALB> looking for a foreign husband.ALB> ""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
ALB> Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""--

â€œThank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!

Blessings to all of you.â€-- Frankie R.Location: West Coast, USAâ€œIâ€™m a man of my 40â€™s and I really know my stuff.

32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any Webpage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Â Â Â Â Â  It's true.
Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.Â  They'll
tell you it's true.Â  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.Â  They'll agree
100% that it's true.Â  Don't just take my word for it.
In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.Â  Really, they
can.Â  But, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
Â Â Â Â  One of those necessities is a website.
Â Â Â Â  Now, your website does one of two things...
Â Â Â Â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
Poor sales letters.
Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.Â  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.Â  Write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.Â  Why?
Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.Â  Keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) Use an illustration to get your point across.Â  In my
sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across Montana on a grizzly bear.Â  Leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.Â  Tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.Â  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""Â  It effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.Â  Your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.Â  Go back to the beginning of this article.Â  The first
words were, ""It's true.""Â  I can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
about.Â  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.Â  Carefully craft your first
line.Â  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.Â  Shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.Â  Hit them with your best shot.
Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.Â  By offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.Â  After all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) Just let it all flow out.Â  Write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
can edit it later.Â  If you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.Â  Write it ALL down.Â  Then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.Â  Edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) Make your sales letter personal.Â  Make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
yourself.Â  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""Â  Leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.Â  When you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.Â  It's a free service.Â  Make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) Write like you speak.Â  Forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.Â  Write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
Hemingway.
9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.Â  Use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
afraid to use short sentences.Â  Like this one.
Or this.
See what I mean?Â  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)Â  Stress the benefits, not the features.Â  Again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
forÂ  me?""Â  What need is it going to meet? What want is it
going to fill?Â  How is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?Â  Spell it out.Â  Don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
For example:Â  If you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.Â  So, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) Keep the reader interested.Â  Some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
understand.Â  Unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) Target your sales letter.Â  When you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.Â  For example: If you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.Â  Then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.Â  Write another
letter targeting senior citizens.Â  Still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.Â  The possibilities are endless.
All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
5 hours a week.""Â  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.Â  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
in a campus ezine.Â  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.Â  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.Â  Use short sentences
and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
Â Â Â Â  ...is to use a pause like this.
Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
HERE to continue.""
14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.Â  When the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""Â  Use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.Â  When you think of Superman, what
comes to mind?Â  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""Â  ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) Focus on one product or service.Â  Don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
confuses the reader.Â  Keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.Â  Then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) Make it stand out.Â  Don't kid yourself.Â  There are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.Â  How will you stand out among the
crowd?Â  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
breathe of originality.Â  Your product or service is
different. It's not like all of the rest.Â  It is unique.
Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.Â  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
Delete.Â  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
something?Â  Get real.Â  Don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.Â  You'll ruin your reputation.
Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.Â  Once you have been branded a liar, you will
NEVER be anything but a liar.Â  It doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.Â  Be believable.
Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
rather be EXACT.Â  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.Â  ""What am I really getting here?Â  Does he even know?""
When you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""This person must have counted.Â  I know exactly what
I can expect.""Â  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.Â  Answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.Â  Think about it from their point of view.
Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""Â  Then, address that
in your sales letter.Â  Remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.Â  Share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. Many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.Â  Satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.Â  ""If these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
probably will too.""Â  Especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.Â  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.Â  A well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.Â  They are
that important.
22) Avoid asking stupid questions.Â  ""Wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
you like to be as successful as I am?""Â  Avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.Â  By offering a free
item, you canÂ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.Â  By doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.Â  One of the things
that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
I am offering.Â  Ginsu made this one famous. They were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
and ""But that's not all.""Â  These phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.Â  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
value and benefits to the reader.
26) Always include a deadline.Â  By including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
bonuses.""Â  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
I've got to hurry.""Â  Let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
are very effective.Â  Every sales letter should have one.
27) Tell them exactly how to order.Â  Be clear as to the
order process. Point them towards the order link.Â  Tell
them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
etc.)Â  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)Â  Explain when the product will be delivered.Â  How
quickly will the order be processed?Â  When will the order be
available?Â  Let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.Â  The more specific you
can be here, the better.Â  Let them know that you have a
system in place.Â  ""Operators are standing by.""Â  Their order
will be handled properly.Â  Tell them.
29) Offer a money back guarantee.Â  Take away their last
reason to hold back.Â  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.Â  Most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.Â  You are REQUIRED to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.Â  Since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service RISK-FREE.
30) Instruct them to respond immediately.Â  Many people
just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""Â  ""Order today!""
""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""Â  You've got them
this far, now tell them what you want them to do.Â  Get them
to ""Act Fast!""Â  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
way?
31) Include a post script.Â  People will always read the
P.S.Â  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
parts of your sales letter. Why?Â  Because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.Â  A
P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. Use
your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
32) Include a second post script.Â  You better believe
if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.Â  Use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.Â  I guarantee you they will read it.
Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.Â  In fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

 32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any WebpageÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  It's true.
Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.Â  They'll
tell you it's true.Â  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.Â  They'll agree
100% that it's true.Â  Don't just take my word for it.
In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.Â  Really, they
can.Â  But, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
Â Â Â Â  One of those necessities is a website.
Â Â Â Â  Now, your website does one of two things...
Â Â Â Â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
Poor sales letters.
Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.Â  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.Â  Write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.Â  Why?
Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.Â  Keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) Use an illustration to get your point across.Â  In my
sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across Montana on a grizzly bear.Â  Leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.Â  Tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.Â  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""Â  It effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.Â  Your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.Â  Go back to the beginning of this article.Â  The first
words were, ""It's true.""Â  I can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
about.Â  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.Â  Carefully craft your first
line.Â  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.Â  Shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.Â  Hit them with your best shot.
Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.Â  By offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.Â  After all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) Just let it all flow out.Â  Write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
can edit it later.Â  If you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.Â  Write it ALL down.Â  Then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.Â  Edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) Make your sales letter personal.Â  Make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
yourself.Â  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""Â  Leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.Â  When you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.Â  It's a free service.Â  Make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) Write like you speak.Â  Forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.Â  Write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
Hemingway.
9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.Â  Use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
afraid to use short sentences.Â  Like this one.
Or this.
See what I mean?Â  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)Â  Stress the benefits, not the features.Â  Again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
forÂ  me?""Â  What need is it going to meet? What want is it
going to fill?Â  How is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?Â  Spell it out.Â  Don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
For example:Â  If you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.Â  So, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) Keep the reader interested.Â  Some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
understand.Â  Unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) Target your sales letter.Â  When you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.Â  For example: If you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.Â  Then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.Â  Write another
letter targeting senior citizens.Â  Still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.Â  The possibilities are endless.
All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
5 hours a week.""Â  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.Â  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
in a campus ezine.Â  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.Â  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.Â  Use short sentences
and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
Â Â Â Â  ...is to use a pause like this.
Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
HERE to continue.""
14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.Â  When the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""Â  Use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.Â  When you think of Superman, what
comes to mind?Â  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""Â  ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) Focus on one product or service.Â  Don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
confuses the reader.Â  Keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.Â  Then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) Make it stand out.Â  Don't kid yourself.Â  There are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.Â  How will you stand out among the
crowd?Â  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
breathe of originality.Â  Your product or service is
different. It's not like all of the rest.Â  It is unique.
Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.Â  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
Delete.Â  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
something?Â  Get real.Â  Don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.Â  You'll ruin your reputation.
Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.Â  Once you have been branded a liar, you will
NEVER be anything but a liar.Â  It doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.Â  Be believable.
Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
rather be EXACT.Â  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.Â  ""What am I really getting here?Â  Does he even know?""
When you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""This person must have counted.Â  I know exactly what
I can expect.""Â  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.Â  Answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.Â  Think about it from their point of view.
Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""Â  Then, address that
in your sales letter.Â  Remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.Â  Share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. Many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.Â  Satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.Â  ""If these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
probably will too.""Â  Especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.Â  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.Â  A well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.Â  They are
that important.
22) Avoid asking stupid questions.Â  ""Wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
you like to be as successful as I am?""Â  Avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.Â  By offering a free
item, you canÂ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.Â  By doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.Â  One of the things
that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
I am offering.Â  Ginsu made this one famous. They were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
and ""But that's not all.""Â  These phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.Â  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
value and benefits to the reader.
26) Always include a deadline.Â  By including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
bonuses.""Â  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
I've got to hurry.""Â  Let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
are very effective.Â  Every sales letter should have one.
27) Tell them exactly how to order.Â  Be clear as to the
order process. Point them towards the order link.Â  Tell
them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
etc.)Â  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)Â  Explain when the product will be delivered.Â  How
quickly will the order be processed?Â  When will the order be
available?Â  Let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.Â  The more specific you
can be here, the better.Â  Let them know that you have a
system in place.Â  ""Operators are standing by.""Â  Their order
will be handled properly.Â  Tell them.
29) Offer a money back guarantee.Â  Take away their last
reason to hold back.Â  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.Â  Most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.Â  You are REQUIRED to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.Â  Since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service RISK-FREE.
30) Instruct them to respond immediately.Â  Many people

31) Include a post script.Â  People will always read the
P.S.Â  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
parts of your sales letter. Why?Â  Because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.Â  A
P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. Use
your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
32) Include a second post script.Â  You better believe
if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.Â  Use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.Â  I guarantee you they will read it.
Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.Â  In fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

- - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this "" linguistic impedance mismatch "" between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines andon statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable ; we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of theworkshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of : ( 1 ) the range of linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) the range of designs in embedded mt systems ( 3 ) how these problems aretreated in different embedded mt systems and ( 4 ) the metrics that are being used to evaluate these systems and their components . dates notice of interest in participation : july 10 , 1998 ( to voss @ arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address : preprocessing in image data , preprocessing in online data , evaluation of embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 final copies of papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions may be in printed or electronic form . submissions should be sent to : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is -

Does anyone know how to set up dual keyboards(one is actually a stand-alone
keypad)?
Both keyboards have PS/2 connections and I want the keypad to be plugged in
as the primary input device.  Then if the other keyboard is plugged in, that
should take over.
Possible?  Any possible hacks?
Thanks!

1736,0.023,0.906,0.07,0.9959,"summary : whatever happened to 'd ? a few weeks ago i posted a query to the list regarding the disappearance of had or its contracted form ' d , in such expressions as she better stop , which appeared in a recent academic publication . i questioned people 's attitudes towards the standardisation of this new form ( better ) , the subsequent status of the bare infinitive ( stop ) , the possibility of its association with the extraposed construction it is better that she stop , ( implying a subjunctive analysis of stop ) and the likelihood of substituting another adjective ( e . g . good ) in place of better has a result of this . i also questioned the possibility of inverting better with the subject in interrogatives , given the analysis of it as an auxiliary form . i received 26 replies , and i would like to thank the following people who sent their comments , and anyone who is yet to do so : tamara al - kasey ; eleanor olds batchelder ; jonathon berg ; claudia brugman ; marsha bundman ; ellen contini - morava ; max copperman ; john cowan ( logical language group ) david fertig ; frederik fouvry ; dorine houston ; marge jackman ; roger lass ; deborah d . kela ruuskanen ; james kirchner ; timothy miller ; catherine rudin ; raphael salkie ; alena sanusi ; hal schiffman ; jane simpson ; dan slobin ; frits stuurman ; larry trask ; ivan uemlianen ; max wheeler . of 18 replies to the question of standardisation , 9 replied that it was not to be considered standard , 9 thought that it was either normal , informal or ok , and 8 did not consider this question . nobody liked the analysis of stop as a subjunctive , 2 people considering that the extraposed derivation sounded educated or stilted . one reply considered that stop was an imperative form . four people replied that better was an auxiliary , 7 thought it was a modal or semi-modal , and 2 thought that the construction was simply idiomatic . john cowan made mention of the use of better in yiddish - influenced american english as a sentence prefix : ' better she should n't go ' . with regard to its inversion in interrogatives , 9 people considered sai was not ok , one person thought it ok to invert in tags , and only one person thought main clause sai sounded ok . i also want to thank frederik fouvry for his reference : "" information based syntax and semantics "" ( hpsg vol . 1 , pollard & sag , 1987 ) in which better is analysed as an auxiliary that does n't allow inversion ; and frits stuurman for his references and comments : in g . gazdar , g . pullum , & i . sag ( 1982 ) "" auxiliaries and related phenomena in a restricted theory of phrase structure "" _ language _ 59 , 3 : 591-638 , pp . 610-611 , there is a reference to aren ' t as a similar case ( aren ' t i vs . i aren ' t ) ; and in gazdar , e . klein , pullum & sag ( 1985 ) _ generalized phrase structure grammar _ ( cambridge , mass . : harvard up ) , p . 64 , and gazdar , pullum & sag ( 1982 ) , p . 611 , footnote 17 , there are references to different meanings of modals like shall and might when inverted for interrogatives . frits stuurman also cites a gpsg reference to the use of better in p . sells ( 1985 ) _ lectures on government - binding theory , generalized phrase structure grammar , and lexical - functional grammar _ ( stanford : csli ) , p . 93 . many people found analogies with other modals that do not invert , e . g . claudia brugman mentions the difficulty of inverting ' she has to stop ' ) * ' has she to stop ? ' and gotta is equally impossible to invert . james kirchner also mentions otta as a similar case . tamara al - kasey compares the negative and the affirmative interrogatives : * ' had she better stop ? ' and ' had n't she better stop ? ' suggesting that the latter is more acceptable . other interesting items were : the vp - deletion version , observed by max wheeler ' we better had ' ; and at least 2 people considered that had seems to return only for inversion for interrogatives . generally , the use of inversion of better + subject was considered more common in tags , especially amongst children or teenagers , and jane simpson thinks that the tag bettern ' t you is now appearing in australian english , with or without the preceding ' d . ivan uemlianen ( british speaker from northern england ) claims he had always used the tag ' bettern ' t i ? ' as a child , which had always struck him as not quite right , and had never heard of the had until he heard it being used in old films . dan slobin considers the use of had to be archaic , or from another variety or era , although the inversion ' better she go ? ' does not appear in the speech of american - english preschoolers in their data . one respondent did n't know where the had came from , and another reanalysed it as would , in the same way as it has been reanalysed in conditional protases . another suggestion was that it was analogous to a pluperfect auxiliary without tense . two replied that the expression she better stop was just an example of sloppy editing . there was little discussion of phonological processes , but , in particular , i found interesting the following comments by roger lass : "" in my dialect anyhow ( new york city middle class ) , it 's certainly normal to say ( and sometimes , in less formal registers , to write ) , i better , you better , he better , we better , they better . . . observe though : all the pronouns end with a vowel , and there are alternative forms , e . g . i 'd better . . . though these are much less common . there is however another type , which is sometimes taken to be better but is n't : you [ b ] better , where there 's a sort of geminate or at least half-long consonant . the very fact that none of the syntactic things you mark with * or ? seem to occur would be an indication that there has not really been any kind of reanalysis , but rather an institutionalization of a fast-speech deletion and / or assimilation , which is creeping up into slower styles ( as often happens ) . in fact the construction itself is weird anyhow , since you had comparative does n't seem to exist , except in archaisms like ' i 'd liefer do that ' ( i can't use it , but i ' ve heard it ) . note also , it 's just occurred to me , that you do n't get deletion of - 'd in * i rather do that . . . "" this last comment i think gives us plenty of scope for more discussion . debbie ziegeler",0

"" deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . "" prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , "" said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . "" but all that is out the window now . "" deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october . while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august . even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence . still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . "" you will see some cancellations and some delays , "" predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston . natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg . a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved . enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank freny patel mumbai 10 / 02 / 2001 business standard 5 copyright ( c ) business standard after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na . against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank . the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot . with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets . property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income . enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot . this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company . the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars . industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired . in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot . four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property . "" most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , "" he added . moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant . copyright ? 2000 dow jones ranking includes 14 newcomers though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business . the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 . in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april . in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in "" patient but not passive , "" the story that accompanies the list , "" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion .

"" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first . in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years .

1745,0.041,0.857,0.102,0.9793,"is just an semi-educated guess - if I'm wrong, someone please correct me!Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.>>From the spamc man page: -u username This argument has been semi-obsoleted. To have spamd use per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config files spamd should load. If you're running spamc as some other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.) then you can still use this flag. The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running spamc. From the procmailrc man page: DROPPRIVS If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges it might have had (suid or sgid). This is only useful if you want to guarantee that the bottom half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on behalf of the recipient.

(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
directional antenna either way.Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 
802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can 
be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately",1

systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools
where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the
hardware functions. Granted, this takes 30 minutes to go over, and so is far
beyond the scope of the ""Learn Java in 90 minutes without thinking"" book

( otcbb : leth ) current price : 2 . 45 near - term target : 7 . 00 projected high for ' 04 : 15 . 00 we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of subscribers for substantial profits immediately ! sales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom line . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market . ( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update : leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months . solving a dual crisis - waste and energy : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . ( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months . the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry pe of 18 - 22 . examining leth - by the numbers total assets : 36 . 8 million = 1 . 26 per share of assets cash : 23 . 4 million = . 80 cents per share of cash shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million shares retired in feb .

( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near - term announcement . stock set to explode on earnings boom : leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s breakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully completed sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very big surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth , while simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global demand to solve two crisis areas , waste and electrical energy , reaches unprecedented levels . required market mover stock report ( mmsr ) information : mmsr cautions that small and micro - cap stocks are high - risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can be lost . we suggest you consult a professional investment advisor before purchasing any stock . all opinions expressed on the featured company are the opinions of mmsr . mmsr recommends you use the information found here as an initial starting point for conducting your own research and your own due diligence on the featured company in order to determine your own personal opinion of the company before investing . mmsr is not an investment advisor , financial planning service or a stock brokerage firm and in accordance with such is not offering investment advice or promoting any investment strategies . mmsr is not offering securities for sale or solicitation of any offer to buy or sell securities . mmsr has received twelve thousand dollars from an unaffiliated third party for the preparation of this company profile . since we have received compensation there is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and opinions . readers of this publication are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements , which are based on certain assumptions and expectations involving various risks and uncertainties , that could cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements . iqrf gisvhq jyip m wcgjlusxi m j ngyl jlri oiyg",1

4 , 1999 at the palazzo ducale in genova , italy introduction the international symposia on intelligent industrial automation ( iia ' 99 ) and soft computing ( soco ' 99 ) intend to encompass short-to - long-term effects of advanced information technology , soft computing and other related ' intelligent technolgies ' in application fields such as industrial automation , control , diagnostics , computer vision , robotics , speech recognition and machine translation . the general aim of the symposia is to address and underline the existing and emerging relationships between automation , manufacturing and intelligent technolgies , with particular emphasis on soft computing . contributions are sought on intelligent automation and manufacturing with emphasis on current and potential applications , with a broad interest in all the engineering disciplines , computer science and related technology fields . following the success of iia / soco ' 96 ( reading , england ) and iia / soco ' 97 ( nmes , france ) , the third symposium will be held in genova , italy . the iia / soco series have established themselves as a platform for scientists and practitioners from academic , governmental and industrial institutions to discuss new developments and results in the field of intelligent technologies . a further follow-up conference has already been scheduled for the year 2001 in paisley , scotland . purpose of iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 advances in soft computing and related techniques : theory and applications . ait ( advanced information technology ) is one of the major technological drivers in the advancement of modern society . nowadays any major achievement , related to any field of research , is strongly supported by proper ait based tools . very often , such achievements have only been possible after a proper ait approach has been designed and implemented . it is widely known that ait has a very strong impact on society itself , radically changing the skills and competencies required in order to contribute to the everyday human environment . given that nowadays the major effort in ait development is spent in the so called ' soft - computing ' arena and that some of the major and indeed , surprising , achievements in industrial applications come from the application of soft-computing techniques , the two symposia ( iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 ) will have many common areas of interest , namely : - neural networks - fuzzy logic - genetic algorithms - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - machine learning - pattern recognition and image understanding the programs of the two conferences will , however , reflect different themes : - iia ' 99 will be directed toward the medium-to - short term , application driven , research area in intelligent technologies . - soco ' 99 is directed toward the long term research in area of soft computing in order to try to overcome the usual borderline existing between theory and application , the two symposia are run jointly , organized in a way to have partial overlap with some joint sessions and some common plenary sessions . aim of iia ' 99 / soco ' 99 1 . to give both a wide and a deep view of advances in ait advancement offered by soft-computing technologies . 2 . to give both the industrial and academic researcher the opportunity to discuss together real problems and opportunities . 3 . to collect ' best practice ' and information on how to perform experiments , tests and design products and processes embedding and / or using soft-computing technologies . 4 . to explicitly and actively function as a ' technology broker ' , giving the opportunity for people to become aware of new problems and possible solutions and giving the possibility of finding technological partners for joint research and / or future application programs . topics of iia ' 99 iia ' 99 will include contributions in the research area of soft computing application and , more in general , related to medium-to - short term and application driven developments advanced information technology and industrial intelligent technology . particular emphasis will be laid on industrial realization , experimental application , application methodology development and / or formalization , quantitative and qualitative problem modeling . contributions are sought mainly in the areas based on the list below : a ) industrial area - industry - energy - transportation - services - consumer - etc . b ) high - tech area - innovative control and diagnostics - computer vision - robotics and remote sensing - speech recognition and machine translation - etc . c ) green - tech area - intelligent resource management - intelligent pollutant management - user behavior modeling - intelligent traffic control - etc . topics of soco ' 99 soco ' 99 will include contributions on long term research ( theory development , enhanced approaches , formal methods comparisons , applications , etc . ) in the area of soft-computing . contributions are sought in areas based on the list below , which is indicative only . - neural networks - fuzzy logic - rough sets - genetic algorithms and evolutionary computing - chaos theory - ai and expert systems - probabilistic reasoning - machine learning - learning algorithms and intelligent control - pattern recognition and image understanding - distributed intelligence - self - organizing systems - fuzzy databases and information retrieval - educational aspects of soft computing special session a special session on ' intelligent systems in control and process optimization ' including a plenary lecture is sponsored by the ifs network and organized by alberto servida , italy . contributions are welcome . conference location the symposia will be held at the palazzo ducale , a beautiful historic building in the city centre of genova , italy sponsors iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 are sponsored by : -

! ! this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it . treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time . 1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . 2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 . 3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 . 4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 . 5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical to your success . * * * * take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but let ' s just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s 100 people who responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming online every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !

When studying xfs code(2.4.19), I found that the inode will be locked by 
XFS_ILOCK_SHARE flags before we get acl, which may cause deadlock.
Because when getting acl, it will allocate memory in KM_SLEEP, If the 
memory is tight, the process will call xfs_strategy, and may 
lock(XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)the same inode again. If between these two locks, 
another process try to lock the inode by XFS_ILOCK_EXCL, these two 
processes  will be deadlock. As follows,    A process get ea                         B process want lock ipA1) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)             .....................

Unless each key on my keyboard were

I can't think of any of my usual job
mix that would need hundreds, or even
tens, of async requests; perhaps you
can explain how nontrivial apps will
be compellingly useful? > but it's still not built in, who knows when it will be. The point is it's
> not portable in either case.Does that lack of portability imply it
isn't generally useful?  (When it was
apparent that TCP networks were useful,
berkeley sockets could be found even
on VMS and Win 3.1 boxen)Why would early Unix have run with the
idea that, if one wishes to do multiple
things at the same time, one can use a
group of processes to do them?- they had Multics as a counterexample?- in the days of tiny memories and tapes,
  people were more accustomed to writing
  programs that didn't run entirely in a
  single address space?- one is a great number for an interface,
  as log(1) is 0, and specification can
  be implicit?- some combination of the above?Now, as Hoare says:
> There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make

> make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.As programmers, we've been able to make
our lives complicated for at least half
a century; the hardware interrupt gives
us the rope.Part of Dijkstra's inspiration for THE
was the counterexample of IBM's multi-
programmed boxes (were these the same
ones that inspired Mythical Man Month?)
and I suppose he would say the question
is how not to make a mess of it -- how
should we structure computations so if
we try to do ten times as many things
at the same time, reasoning about the
resulting system is at most ten times
more complex -- not one hundred, and
certainly not three and a half million
times more.Compared to that project, the prospect
of writing a driver library for various
vendors' aio implementations seems to
be truly trivial.-Dave(Oracle, in their quest for portability,
used to use raw disks for the database.
This finessed the filesystem issue; did
it also allow them to roll their own set
of async drivers?)

I got codeblue, (btw mystical mike your auto-download script for you counter gives me a 500 error), a log checking utility mystical mike wrote and released under the GNU GPL to make the world a better place.If this tool is run as root (say nightly from roots crontab) there is a potential remote root. in any case, regardless of user, there is always a remote. if codeblue is locally suid, theres many overflows all throughout it, easy peasy like the girls in st patricks!!!.Note st patricks is a great place in sydney, playground of the rich and famous. visit it if you ever visit sydney, tell them i sent you.so lets have a walk through the code, and get a feel for mystical mike, the man behind the mystic.

technique you learned from relatives, books, talk shows, or the last child.Just when you get good at being a parent, you're done.Don't overprotect. I always called this ""First Baby Syndrome"". A 
neighbor at one point had a 4 or 5 year old that would choke on jello, 
probably because she never allowed him to have solid food until he was 
far too old, IMHO. I fed mine cereal, etc., early and let them get the 
hang of it. I always want my kids to be able to handle anything if I'm 
not there so I have them try it out when I am. (Within limits of 
course.) Of course, I'm now beating up my body at Vans Skate Park trying 
to do 5ft. half pipes on speed skates with my 10 year old daughter.sdwGary Lawrence Murphy wrote:>>>>>>""t"" == tomwhore   writes:

ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) . according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan . key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b bear stearns $ 625 m tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 % tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 % current projected blended ir : 5 . 38 % maturity date : august 29 , 2001 for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis . socal edison and bankruptcy at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash . the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0

( data are cited in kingston & diehl 1994 : 432-434 . [ kingston , john , and randy l . diehl , 1994 , phonetic knowledge , _ language _ 70 : 3 . 419-454 . ] ) what is the story about pretonic intervocalic allophones after unstressed , short vowels , e . g . fidelity , legality , mobility ? to my ear they sound the same as in delegate , gallon , billion , but to my english - prejudiced ear they also sound voiced . 2 . what is the story about laryngealization or creaky voice ? i have seen this described as "" a very slow vibration through only one end of the vocal cords "" ( crystal , _ dictionary of linguistics _ ( ? inexact citation ) ) . what are the arytenoid cartilages doing at the posterior end of the vocal folds ? how is it related to the closure for glottal stop and for glottalized consonants ? 3 . what is going on with the articulation of "" stage whispered "" speech ? in whisper , the arytenoids are rotated so as to adduct the posterior ends of the vocal folds at their anterior ends , but the posterior ends of the arytenoids are not themselves adducted by the interarytenoid muscles , leaving a restricted , triangular opening at which sibilant-like turbulence is generated in place of voice . introspecting , stage whisper seems to me to be like whisper only with some turbulence as air passes the closure of the main ( anterior ) portion of the vocal folds . there seems to be somewhat higher subglottal air pressure , like a "" shouted "" whisper , but it does not seem to be merely a question of forcing air past the closed vocal folds . there seem to be some additional differences of articulation to produce the turbulence over the vocal folds , as evidenced at least by increased tension in observable laryngeal and ( to some extent ) pharyngeal muscles . it also seems to me that some degree of pharyngealization is an incidental byproduct . 4 . how is this related to pharyngeal spirants , as exemplified by arabic ? 5 . kingston and diehl ( 1994 : 441 ) say that "" in languages such as english "" ( meaning , i take it , languages without contrastive voiced aspirates ) the phonological distinction [ + / - voice ] is signaled in part by aspiration initially , but not ( if i read them right ) intervocalically . more important , it is said , is the ratio of duration of consonants to duration of vowels , or perhaps the duration of v to vc syllable rimes ( ? ) . can someone say more about this ? these questions bear on characteristics of a language i am working on . in the near term for purposes of defining the issues and refining research strategy , specific information will be more helpful to me than pointers to the literature , because my access to research library resources is not easy ( actually , it 's rather difficult ) , but i will need the pointers too and must of course eventually follow them up . all help will be greatly appreciated . please respond to me and not to the list . if there is interest i will post a summary . bruce nevin bn @ lightstream . com",0

1845,0.016,0.882,0.102,0.9994,"your help needed please - cross - commodity reporting please excuse the long e - mail below - i knew we ' d never get a chance to all get together , and this is somewhat urgent as i have to complete the finance committee presentation for the upcoming bod meeting by the end of next week , and it will include trading results for the lst quarter , reported in accordance with the risk management policy . due to issues noted below , this may require immediate attention by your staff as we have a few short days to come up with the best quality numbers we can . i talked to beth already , and mrm met with chris abel ' s group to see if there was a short cut , but our joint conclusion was that the business unit controllers need to be involved in this process as you are the experts on your businesses and can apply the best judgment to decide on the trading results to be reported to the bod . we ' ll probably need to go with our best estimate of 3 / 30 # s as of end of the day next tuesday or wednesday at the latest . as you recall , the february 12 th bod meeting resulted in a clarification that the bod approved trading limits were limits on the generic commodity groups defined , and accordingly the trading results must be reported consistent with that limit structure ( management reporting can be different of course ) . chris abel ' s global energy operations group has prepared a "" rac "" dpr that attempts to aggregate the commodity groups in accordance with the risk management policy , so that top management and the bod can see enron ' s exposure to individual commodities on a consolidated basis . ( a ) this dpr will not impact actual sharing of p / l from a management reporting / business unit perspective - this is purely for market risk management purposes and reporting to the bod . but commercial management will need to review and sign off on the rac dpr and monitor limits accordingly , as these limits are at an enron level . the specific trading results we need for the bod presentation are the first quarter p / l and average daily var , by commodity group . the first rac dpr available is as of 3 / 30 - so while it has cumulative p / l , var is only as of 3 / 30 . ( note - we ' re also comparing to lq 2000 , but we ' re not going to attempt to resolve cross - commodity reporting for that period except at a high level ) . your participation is needed in resolving : 1 ) cross - commodity reporting per the new rac dpr - both retroactively for the lst quarter , and going forward , and 2 ) rovar ( return on average daily var by commodity group ) for the lst quarter . this aggregation of cross - commodity activity has been completed by chris as of 3 / 30 , so he has what he believes to be p / l aggregated for the quarter in accordance with the policy . what we don ' t have is var on a daily basis as the first time it was calculated on an aggregated basis was on 3 / 30 . obviously we ' re not going to be able to go back and calculate daily var for the entire quarter by commodity group aggregated in this new manner - especially within a week . so it appears we ' ll need to "" swag "" average daily var - by reviewing the cross commodity positions aggregated at 3 / 30 , by considering cross - commodity activity you ' re aware of that took place throughout the quarter , and using our best estimate of the impact on var for this cross commodity activity . due to this adjustment in historical reporting practices , we feel a certain level of due diligence is required for us to feel confident we ' re reporting to the bod in accordance with the policy . and since we only have a few days , i thought a team approach to tackling the review would facilitate a prompt resolution of material issues , and then you and chris ' group can work out your processes and procedures on how to handle going forward as you see fit . when you consider materiality , please involve your market risk contact - while a transaction / position / book may not be material to gas or power , it may be material to global products , weather , etc . . would you please help us with the following : ? confirm your review of chris ' aggregation on the rac dpr at 3 / 30 ( chris ' staff can walk you through ) ? are all the cross - commodity positions you ' re aware of being reported correctly ? ? is there other cross - commodity activity not present at 3 / 30 and consequently not aggregated for the quarter ' s results , but actually present during the first quarter and material ? if so , estimate impact on p / l and average daily var . ? we ' re not expecting an exhaustive search or analysis - perhaps you can simply discuss this issue with the traders who handle this type of activity to get a feel , and if they point on specific material transactions , we can address those ; you can determine best approach ? are there certain books in risktrac that have cross - commodity positions imbedded / combined - either held currently or those that generated significant var or p / l during the quarter ? going forward these will need to be reported separately to facilitate risk reporting , but in the next week what we need is an estimate of the impact on the corresponding commodities , or a conclusion that the impact is immaterial . ? once you ' ve reviewed the summary of cross commodity activity per the rac dpr and per your own knowledge , help us estimate the impact on the respective commodities ' average daily var for the quarter - you can discuss with your market risk contact your recommendation on a reasonable "" swag "" approach . after considering the information above , please provide your assessment on whether you are in fact able to capture and report all the cross - commodity activity , and if not , identify the issues involved and whether it is something that market risk needs to address , or if it will simply take more time to resolve the reporting details . if you have other recommendations on how to get comfortable with the trading results for the quarter , please feel free to pursue those . i do not mean to imply i know how to do your jobs , or that you ' re not doing them - i simply want to coordinate with you to ensure the # s we report to the bod are the numbers you agree with , and that if they ' re not completely accurate given recent implementation , that we are able to articulate and estimate the potential misstatement , if any . as you are the experts on your businesses ' results , i simply wanted to make sure i closed the loop with what we in mrm understand regarding your reporting of the cross - commodity activity and trading results and the application of the policy . on a separate note , we need you to identify p / l related to special transactions that flowed through the dpr , but do not really represent trading activity - examples in the past are sfas 125 transactions and other unique gain / loss events - we ' re reporting lq 2001 and lq 2000 , so whatever we can recall about last year will also be considered . we will be sending you a reconciliation from the dpr to the bod package that we use to document any special adjustments , and will discuss this with you to come to an agreement on adjustments to the dpr reporting to derive true trading activity . these adjustments should be minimal , but we ' d like your input to conclude . thank you for your cooperation , regards , cassandra schultz x 30429 713 858 2618 cell 936 321 2185 home ( a ) for example , north american electricity limits represent enron ' s consolidated na electricity trading activity , without regard to which business unit or commodity group actually executes the trades or holds positions . so if power has some gas positions for hedges or other reasons , these gas trades need to be removed from power var and p / l and combined with gas ' var and p / l , etc . . heating oil positions held outside global products should be aggregated with global products ; global products ' positions in gas and power should be aggregated with gas and power , with corresponding adjustment to global products ' results .",0

# business and finance data visualization ( data profiling ) ; # automated or assisted map , graph , diagram , or image construction from text or data ; event , process , and knowledge editing and visualization tools ; # and knowledge navigation over databases , texts , and search results . the specific issues addressed by the workshop include but are not limited to : 1 . definition of content : different disciplines and applications have distinct perspectives on what content is , e . g . , of text , video , graphics , collections of interactions or correspondences . 2 . knowledge representation : i . e . , what it is , how to represent it , reason about it , and present it . 3 . taxonomies of content representations , tasks , and visualization artifacts . 4 . representations for content and how these relate to and / or facilitate visualization tasks . 5 . selection and organization of content : deciding what to present and how to organize the presentation of selected content and why ( i . e . , effect ) . 6 . deciding how to coordinate the presentation of content through several media : 7 . the relationship of cognitive task to visualization content and style ( e . g . , visualization structure , properties , form , coherency , interpretability , and accuracy of displays ) . 8 . deciding how to accept and integrate input from several media . 9 . medium - specific encoding of content . 10 . presentation and interaction techniques of generated results . 11 . tailoring visualizations to specific user and usergroup characteristics , knowledge , and interests . 12 . content visualization evaluation metrics and methods . we encourage submissions of demonstrations and / or videos of working visualizations pertaining to the above topics . the organizers will produce a workshop report and , providing there is sufficient interest and adequate results reported , will consider a special edited journal issue and / or state of the art collection . authors are encouraged to submit their workshop papers simultaneously for public discussion to the area intelligence user interfaces of the electronic transactions on artificial intelligence ( etai ) . the etai is a new kind of electronic journal using open and posteriori reviewing . formally , the rules work as follows . in the etai , you first have the article discussed for three months , then you have a chance to revise it based on the feedback , and then you decide whether to submit it for refereeing in the etai or in some other journal . for more information , see : http : / / www . ida . liu . se / ext / etai / . sponsors : sigmedia ( acl 's special interest group on multimedia language processing ) acl / coling program committee : elisabeth andre , dfki saarbruecken branimir boguraev , ibm watson research steve feiner , columbia university michael johnston , oregon graduate institute mark maybury , mitre corporation james pustejovsky , brandeis university steve roth , carnegie mellon university wolfgang wahlster , dfki saarbruecken kent wittenburg , gte laboratories program chairs : james pustejovsky , brandeis university mark t . maybury , mitre requirements for submission : papers are invited that address any of the topics listed above . maximum length is 8 pages including figures and references . please use us or a4 letter format and set margins so that the text lies within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inches ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical fonts such as times roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 points for text , 14 to 16 points for headings and title . latex users are encouraged to use the acl style file for latex . ms - word users should use the acl style file for ms - word . submissions can be made either as hardcopies or electronically in ascii , postscript , html , or ms - word format . they should be sent to : james pustejovsky cvir ' 98 computer science department 258 volen brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 email : jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu more detailed information on the workshop can be found at : http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ jamesp / cvir / timetable * deadline for electronic submissions : march 11 , 1998 * deadline for hardcopy submissions : march 13 ( arrival date ) * notification of acceptance : may 1 , 1998 * final manuscripts due : june 12 , 1998 organizer information : mark t . maybury , director advanced information systems center the mitre corporation ( ms k308 ) 202 burlington road bedford , ma 01730 tel : 1-78 - 271-7230 fax : 1-781 - 271-2780 maybury @ mitre . org james pustejovsky , associate professor computer science department and volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu james pustejovsky associate professor computer science department and volen center for complex systems brandeis university waltham , ma 02254-9110 usa voice : 1-781 - 736-2709 fax : 1-781 - 736-2741 jamesp @ cs . brandeis . edu http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ jamesp http : / / www . cs . brandeis . edu / ~ rllc",0

discussing TeS, (considering that you know *nothing* about it), certainly
looks like you are simply trying to throw doubt/negativity onto razor.Personally, I haven't used razor for a few months now because I want to
integrate it into qmail-scanner *without* spam assassin, but haven't had the
time to do that, so even I can't comment on Razor at all.....Vipul & co, I think it would be great if there was more transparency in the
whole server process, ie, if you know there is a problem, then tell all of
us, this will avoid all the stupid ""Oh, it isn't working again, and it took
me 324 days to work it out"" etc...Just my $1 worth...Regards,

"" * always provide same-day service on the orders you receive . * be patient and persistent with this program . if you follow the instructions exactly , the results will undoubtedly be successful ! * above all , have faith in yourself and know you will succeed ! * * * * * * * your success guideline * * * * * * * follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do n't receive 10 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks , continue advertising until you do . then , a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for report # 2 . if you do n't , continue advertising until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income , send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again ! there is no limit to the income you will generate from this business ! * * * * * * * t e s t i m o n i a l s * * * * * * * this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it won't work and you ' ll lose a lot of potential income . i ' m living proof that it works . it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . if you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you ' ll be on your way to financial security . sean mclaughlin , jackson , ms my name is frank . my wife , doris , and i live in bel - air , md . i am a cost accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make pretty good money . when i received the program i grumbled to doris about receiving "" junk mail . "" i made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . i "" knew "" it would n't work . doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old "" i told you so "" on her when the thing did n't work . . . well , the laugh was on me ! within two weeks she had received over 50 responses . within 45 days she had received over $ 147 , 200 in $ 5 bills ! i was shocked ! i was sure that i had it all figured and that it would n't work . i am a believer now . i have joined doris in her "" hobby . "" i did have seven more years until retirement , but i think of the "" rat race "" and it 's not for me . we owe it all to mlm . frank t . , bel - air , md the main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . i was approached several times before i checked this out . i joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . to my astonishment , i received $ 36 , 470 . 00 in the first 14 weeks , with money still coming in . sincerely yours , phillip a . brown , esq . not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . but conservative that i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i would n't get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i surprised when i found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! for awhile , it got so overloaded that i had to start picking up my mail at the window . i ' ll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before . the nice thing about this deal is that it does n't matter where in the u . s . the people live . there simply is n't a better investment with a faster return . mary rockland , lansing , mi this is my third time to participate in this plan . we have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . the only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it . for your sake , and for your family 's sake do n't pass up this golden opportunity . good luck and happy spending ! charles fairchild , spokane , wa order your reports today and get started on your road to financial freedom ! ! !",1

"" > from that time laid-off faculty will have 120 days remaining on the payroll . the athletic department is eliminating golf , track and field , and one or two other minor sports , a cut of about $ 200 - $ 250k . the football and basketball programs are untouched ; the baseball program has lost a number of scholarships ( according to this morning 's sports section of the san diego union - tribune ) . at this point there is no word of cuts in administration . cuts in the school of business have apparently been trivial in comparison with those suffered by the college of arts and letters , the college of sciences , and other colleges . some affected faculty are contemplating legal action , and other remedies are being discussed . three administrative moves may have some potential for reversing the layoffs : cutting ( or eliminating ) intercollegiate athletics , instituting a golden handshake program , and instituting a university-wide salary reduction of up to 10 % . although the union is currently negotiating a golden handshake program , we do n't know how far along the negotiations are and whether it will be possible to put it in place quickly enough to have an effect on the current crisis . there are legal and adminstrative problems with the salary cut . we do n't know whether they ' re surmountable or not . the whole california state university system - - 20 campuses , including the new one at san marcos in northern san diego county - - face the same funding shortfall , but apparently ( we have at this point hardly any information ) campus responses vary a good deal . we ask that you consider writing to pres . thomas b . day , san diego state university , san diego , ca 92182 , expressing outrage at this unprecedented frontal assault on tenure and the centrality of academics to the university . if the attack is allowed to stand , the consequences for higher education within california and everywhere are incalculable . more importantly , we ask that you write to california state legislators and state senators . we will provide names and addresses if you contact us . we would be grateful for copies of any correspondence sent in connection with this crisis . we are sending this information out now , incomplete though it is , in order that linguists may be informed as early as possible in this developing crisis . jeff kaplan charlotte webb ( chair , linguistics and oriental languages dept )",0

MTA level filtering would just need to use a different corpus, one that 
would contain illegal or otherwise commonly unapproved material for the 
group of people using that MTA.   I'm sure that such an approach would 
significantly reduce the mail traffic as a first step, without  giving  
false positives.MUA corpus would then be personally trained -- although I'd like the 
option of 'down-loadable' corpuses and merge functionality.HarriPS.  Just joined the list, so pardon if my thoughts have been hashed 
through before.

european internal users will be launched shortly after north america . external customers will follow a few days later . one of the purposes of the internal launch is to simulate the system load which will be caused by the full customer launch . accordingly , we appreciate your cooperation in helping us to simulate this load by logging into http : / / prod . enrononline . com ( no www . ) this is a live web site and all trades are real . new features ( as per recent presentations and training sessions ) include : ? price limit orders ? enhanced customization ? floating windows ? market news and quotes ? weather maps and tables ? industry - specific publications ? market - specific homepages 2 . version 2 . 0 launch date enrononline version 2 . 0 will be launched to the public a few days after our internal launch . we will be using the new version internally from wednesday , sept . 13 . this will provide an opportunity for you to become familiar with using the new application in the production environment before our customers start to use it . 3 . new website feature details price limit orders : customers have the ability to set up orders that automatically execute as soon as the price and volume requested become available . the limit orders remain open in the system until they are executed , cancelled by the user , or when they expire . all pending orders will expire no later than 12 hours after being placed . pending price limit orders will appear in a new window below the quotes screen in the website . product tabs : enrononline users can use enhanced filtering capabilities to create separate page tabs for the products that interest them . users can instantly access each page tab with a click of their mouse . sort ordering can be changed by clicking on a column heading , with multiple sorts possible by holding down the shift key while clicking . floating windows : users have the ability to create multiple windows with different products by right - clicking on the products in the main quotes screen . market news : website users can now access the latest headlines , sports and industry news from reuters . furthermore , the information categories

limit orders . you will notice that there is a new button at the top of the stack manager , which will open a window showing a summary of the best price limit order bids and offers against your managed products . you can click the "" + "" sign to the left of a summary to show a list of all the price limit orders which have been placed against that product . under normal circumstances , the price shown on the website will be the same as the price on your stack manager . however , the system will not allow you to show a price which is better than an existing price limit order . instead , the system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing price limit order while it is being filled . once the appropriate price limit orders are filled , then the website will again show your stack manager prices . it is important that you complete the  & maximum volume  8 field in the product properties window and that you select "" allow price limit orders "" . also , make sure that the price tick window in the stack manager  , s  & product properties  8 field is appropriate for the product . if you do not do this , your customers will not be able to use price limit orders for your products . 5 . your participation please log in to http : / / prod . enrononline . com ( no www . ) on wednesday . to ensure enrononline version 2 . 0 is a success , it is important

Date: Not suppliedMoller, a public company in Davis, California, has developed a flying car.      [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/flyingcar.jpg] Moller International 
    has developed the first and only feasible, personally affordable, personal 
    vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle the world has ever seen.     You've always known it was just a matter of time before the world demanded 
    some kind of flying machine which would replace the automobile. Of course, 
    this machine would have to be capable of VTOL, be easy to maintain, cost 
    effective and reliable. Well, we at Moller International believe we have 
    come up with the solution. That solution is the volantor named M400 Skycar.
